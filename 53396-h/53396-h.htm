<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>The present volume has not been designed as
a systematic treatise on astronomy. There are
many excellent books of that kind, suitable for
serious students as well as the general reader;
but they are necessarily somewhat dry and unattractive,
because they must aim at completeness.
Completeness means detail, and detail
means dryness.</p>

<p>But the science of astronomy contains subjects
that admit of detached treatment; and as many
of these are precisely the ones of greatest general
interest, it has seemed well to select several, and
describe them in language free from technicalities.
It is hoped that the book will thus prove useful
to persons who do not wish to give the time
required for a study of astronomy as a whole, but
who may take pleasure in devoting a half-hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
now and then to a detached essay on some special
topic.</p>

<p>Preparation of the book in this form has made
it suitable for prior publication in periodicals;
and the several essays have in fact all been
printed before. But the intention of collecting
them into a book was kept in mind from the
first; and while no attempt has been made at
consecutiveness, it is hoped that nothing of
merely ephemeral value has been included.</p>

<p>A short time ago the writer had occasion to
rummage among the archives of the Royal Astronomical
Society in London, to consult, if possible,
the original manuscripts left by one Stephen
Groombridge, an English astronomer of the good
old days, who died in 1832. It was known that
they had been filed away about a generation ago,
by the late Sir George Airy, who was Astronomer
Royal of England between the years 1835 and
1881. After a long search, a large and dusty
box was found and opened. It was filled with
documents, of which the topmost was in Sir
George's own handwriting, and began substantially
as follows:</p>

<p>"List of articles within this box.</p>

<p class="noindent pad6">
"No. 1, This list,<br />
"No. 2, etc., etc."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Astronomical precision can no further go: he
had listed even the list itself. Truly, Airy was
rightly styled "prince of precisians." A worthy
Astronomer Royal was he, to act under the
royal warrant of Charles II., who established the
office in 1675. Down to this present day that
warrant still makes it the duty of His Majesty's
Astronomer "to apply himself with the most
exact care and diligence to the rectifying of the
tables of the motions of the heavens and the
places of the fixed stars, in order to find out the
so much desired longitude at sea, for the perfecting
the art of navigation."</p>

<p>The "so much desired longitude at sea" is,
indeed, a vastly important thing to a maritime
nation like England. And only in comparatively
recent years has it become possible and easy for
vessels to be navigated with safety and convenience
upon long voyages. The writer was well
acquainted with an old sea-captain of New York,
who had commanded one of the earliest transatlantic
steamers, and who died only a few years ago.
He had a goodly store of ocean yarn, fit and
ready for the spinning, if he could but find some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>one
who, like himself, had known and loved the
ocean. In his early sea-going days, only the
wealthiest of captains owned chronometers. This
instrument is now considered indispensable in
navigation, but at that time it was a new invention,
very rare and costly. Upon a certain
voyage from England to Rio Janeiro, in South
America, the old captain could remember the
following odd method of navigation: The ship
was steered by compass to the southward and
westward, more or less, until the skipper's
antique quadrant showed that they had about
reached the latitude of Rio. Then they swung
her on a course due west by compass, and away
she went for Rio, relying on the lookout man forward
to keep the ship from running ashore. For
after a certain lapse of time, being ignorant of the
longitude, they could not know whether they
would "raise" the land within an hour or in six
weeks. We are glad of an opportunity to put
this story on record, for the time is not far distant
when there will be no man left among the living
who can remember how ships were taken across
the seas in the good old days before chronometers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Anyone who has ever been a passenger on a
great transatlantic liner of to-day knows what an
important, imposing personage is the brass-bound
skipper. A very different creature is he on the
deck of his ship from the modest seafaring man we
meet on land, clad for the time being in his shore-going
togs. But the captain's dignity is not all
brass buttons and gold braid. He has behind
him the powerful support of a deep, delightful
mystery. He it is who "takes the sun" at
noon, and finds out the ship's path at sea. And
in truth, regarded merely as a scientific experiment,
the guiding of a vessel across the unmarked
trackless ocean has few equals within the whole
range of human knowledge. It is our purpose
here to explain quite briefly the manner in which
this seeming impossibility is accomplished. We
shall not be able to go sufficiently into details to
enable him who reads to run and navigate a magnificent
steamer. But we hope to diminish somewhat
that small part of the captain's vast dignity
which depends upon his mysterious operations
with the sextant.</p>

<p>To begin, then, with the sextant itself. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
nothing but an instrument with which we can
measure how high up the sun is in the sky. Now,
everyone knows that the sun slowly climbs the
sky in the morning, reaches its greatest height at
noon, and then slowly sinks again in the afternoon.
The captain simply begins to watch the
sun through the sextant shortly before noon,
and keeps at it until he discovers that the sun is
just beginning to descend. That is the instant of
noon on the ship. The captain quickly glances
at the chronometer, or calls out "noon" to an
officer who is near that instrument. And so the
error of the chronometer becomes known then
and there without any further astronomical calculations
whatever. Navigators can also find the
chronometer error by sextant observations when
the sun is a long way from noon. The methods
of doing this are somewhat less simple than for
the noon observation; they belong to the details
of navigation, into which we cannot enter here.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the captain also notes with the
sextant how high the sun was in the sky at the
noon observation. He has in his mysterious
"chart-room" some printed astronomical tables,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
which tell him in what terrestrial latitude the sun
will have precisely that height on that particular
day of the year. Thus the terrestrial latitude becomes
known easily enough, and if only the captain
could get his longitude too, he would know
just where his ship was that day at noon.</p>

<p>We have seen that the sextant observations
furnish the error of the chronometer according to
ship's time. In other words, the captain is in
possession of the correct local time in the place
where the ship actually is. Now, if he also had
the correct time at that moment of some well-known
place on shore, he would know the difference
in time between that place on shore and the
ship. But every traveller by land or sea is aware
that there are always differences of time between
different places on the earth. If a watch be
right on leaving New York, for instance, it will
be much too fast on arriving at Chicago or San
Francisco; the farther you go the larger becomes
the error of your watch. In fact, if you could
find out how much your watch had gone into
error, you would in a sense know how far east or
west you had travelled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the captain's chronometer is set to correct
"Greenwich time" on shore before the ship
leaves port. His observations having then told
him how much this is wrong on that particular
day, and in that particular spot where the ship is,
he knows at once just how far he has travelled
east or west from Greenwich. In other words,
he knows his "longitude from Greenwich," for
longitude is nothing more than distance from
Greenwich in an east-and-west direction, just as
latitude is only distance from the equator measured
in a north-and-south direction. Greenwich
observatory is usually selected as the beginning
of things for measuring longitudes, because it is
almost the oldest of existing astronomical establishments,
and belongs to the most prominent
maritime nation, England.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting bits of astronomical
history was enacted in connection with this
matter of longitude. From what has been said,
it is clear that the ship's longitude will be obtained
correctly only if the chronometer has kept
exact time since the departure of the ship from
port. Even a very small error of the chronom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>eter
will throw out the longitude a good many
miles, and we can understand readily that it must
be difficult in the extreme to construct a mechanical
contrivance capable of keeping exact time
when subjected to the rolling and pitching of a
vessel at sea.</p>

<p>It was as recently as the year 1736 that the
first instrument capable of keeping anything like
accurate time at sea was successfully completed.
It was the work of an English watchmaker
named John Harrison, and is one of the few
great improvements in matters scientific which
the world owes to a desire for winning a money
prize. It appears that in 1714 a committee was
appointed by the House of Commons, with no
less a person than Sir Isaac Newton himself as
one of its members, to consider the desirability
of offering governmental encouragement for the
invention of some means of finding the longitude
at sea. Finally, the British Government offered
a reward of $50,000 for an instrument which
would find the longitude within sixty miles;
$75,000, if within forty miles, and $100,000, if
within thirty miles. Harrison's chronometer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
finished in 1736, but he did not receive the final
payment of his prize until 1764.</p>

<p>We shall not enter into a detailed account of
the vexatious delays and official procedures to
which he was forced to submit during those
twenty-eight long years. It is a matter of satisfaction
that Harrison lived to receive the money
which he had earned. He had the genius to
plan and master intricate mechanical details, but
perhaps he lacked in some degree the ability of
tongue and pen to bring them home to others.
This may be the reason he is so little known,
though it was his fortune to contribute so large
and essential a part to the perfection of modern
navigation. Let us hope this brief mention may
serve to recall his memory from oblivion even for
a fleeting moment; that we may not have written
in vain of that longitude to which his life was
given.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PLEIADES" id="THE_PLEIADES"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE PLEIADES</a></h2>


<p>Famed in legend; sung by early minstrels of
Persia and Hindustan;</p>

<p class="pfs80">
"&mdash;like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid";<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">yonder distant misty little cloud of Pleiades has
always won and held the imagination of men.
But it was not only for the inspiration of poets,
for quickening fancy into song, that the seven
daughters of Atlas were fixed upon the firmament.
The problems presented by this group of
stars to the unobtrusive scientific investigator are
among the most interesting known to astronomy.
Their solution is still very incomplete, but what
we have already learned may be counted justly
among the richest spoils brought back by science
from the stored treasure-house of Nature's
secrets.</p>

<p>The true student of astronomy is animated by
no mere vulgar curiosity to pry into things hidden.
If he seeks the concealed springs that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
move the complex visible mechanism of the
heavens, he does so because his imagination is
roused by the grandeur of what he sees; and
deep down within him stirs the true love of the
artist for his art. For it is indeed a fine art, that
science of astronomy.</p>

<p>It can have been no mere chance that has
massed the Pleiades from among their fellow
stars. Men of ordinary eyesight see but a half-dozen
distinct objects in the cluster; those of
acuter vision can count fourteen; but it is not
until we apply the space-penetrating power of
the telescope that we realize the extraordinary
scale upon which the system of the Pleiades is
constructed. With the Paris instrument Wolf in
1876 catalogued 625 stars in the group; and the
searching photographic survey of Henry in 1887
revealed no less than 2,326 distinct stars within
and near the filmy gauze of nebulous matter always
so conspicuous a feature of the Pleiades.</p>

<p>The means at our disposal for the study of
stellar distances are but feeble. Only in the case
of a very small number of stars have we been
able to obtain even so much as an approximate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
estimate of distance. The most powerful observational
machinery, though directed by the tried
skill of experience, has not sufficed to sound the
profounder depths of space. The Pleiad stars
are among those for which no measurement of
distance has yet been made, so that we do not
know whether they are all equally far away from
us. We see them projected on the dark background
of the celestial vault; but we cannot tell
from actual measurement whether they are all
situated near the same point in space. It may be
that some are immeasurably closer to us than are
the great mass of their companions; possibly we
look through the cluster at others far behind it,
clinging, as it were, to the very fringe of the visible
universe.</p>

<p>Farther on we shall find evidence that something
like this really is the case. But under no
circumstances is it reasonable to suppose that the
whole body of stars can be strung out at all sorts
of distances near a straight line pointing in the
direction of the visible cluster. Such a distribution
may perhaps remain among the possibilities,
so long as we cannot measure directly the actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
distances of the individual stars. But science
never accepts a mere possibility against which we
can marshal strong circumstantial evidence. We
may conclude on general principles that the
gathering of these many objects into a single
close assemblage denotes community of origin
and interests.</p>

<p>The Pleiades then really belong to one another.
What is the nature of their mutual tie?
What is their mystery, and can we solve it?
The most obvious theory is, of course, suggested
by what we know to be true within our own
solar system. We owe to Newton the beautiful
conception of gravitation, that unique law by
means of which astronomers have been enabled
to reduce to perfect order the seeming
tangle of planetary evolutions. The law really
amounts, in effect, to this: All objects suspended
within the vacancy of space attract or pull one
another. How they can do this without a visible
connecting link between them is a mystery
which may always remain unsolved. But mystery
as it is, we must accept it as an ascertained
fact. It is this pull of gravitation that holds to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>gether
the sun and planets, forcing them all to
follow out their due and proper paths, and so to
continue throughout an unbroken cycle until the
great survivor, Time, shall be no more.</p>

<p>This same gravitational attraction must be at
work among the Pleiades. They, too, like ourselves,
must have bounds and orbits set and
interwoven, revolutions and gyrations far more
complex than the solar system knows. The
visual discovery of such motion of rotation
among the Pleiades may be called one of the
pressing problems of astronomy to-day. We
feel sure that the time is ripe, and that the discovery
is actually being made at the present moment:
for a generation of men is not too great a
period to call a moment, when we have to deal
with cosmic time.</p>

<p>It is indeed the lack of observations extending
through sufficient centuries that stays our hand
from grasping the coveted result. The Pleiades
are so far from us that we cannot be sure of
changes among them. Magnitudes are always
relative. It matters not how large the actual
movements may be; if they are extremely small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in comparison with our distance, they must
shrink to nothingness in our eyes. Trembling
on the verge of invisibility, elusive, they are in
that borderland where science as yet but feels her
way, though certain that the way is there.</p>

<p>The foundations of exact modern knowledge
of the group were laid by Bessel about 1840.
With the modesty characteristic of the great, he
says quite simply that he has made a number of
measures of the Pleiades, thinking that the time
may come when astronomers will be able to find
some evidence of motion. In this unassuming
way he prefaces what is still the classic model of
precision and thoroughness in work of this kind.
Bessel cleared the ground for a study of inter-stellar
motion within the close star-clusters; and
it is probable that only by such study may we
hope to demonstrate the universality of the law
of gravitation in cosmic space.</p>

<p>Bessel's acuteness in forecasting the direction
of coming research was amply verified by the
work of Elkin in 1885 at Yale College. Provided
with a more modern instrument, but similar
to Bessel's, Elkin was able to repeat his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
observations with a slight increase of precision.
Motions in the interval of forty-five years, sufficiently
great to hint at coming possibilities, were
shown conclusively to exist. Six stars at all
events have been fairly excluded from the group
on account of their peculiar motions shown by
Elkin's research. It is possible that they are
merely seen in the background through the interstices
of the cluster itself, or they may be suspended
between us and the Pleiades, in either
case having no real connection with the group.
Finally, these observations make it reasonably
certain that many of the remaining mass of stars
really constitute a unit aggregation in space.
Astronomers of a coming generation will again
repeat the Besselian work. At present we have
been able to use his method only for the separation
from the true Pleiades of chance stars that
happen to lie in the same direction. Let us hope
that man shall exist long enough upon this earth
to see the clustered stars themselves begin and
carry out such gyrations as gravitation imposes.</p>

<p>These will doubtless be of a kind not even
suggested by the lesser complexities of our solar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
system. For the most wonderful thing of all
about the Pleiades seems to point to an intricacy
of structure whose details may be destined to
shake the confidence of the profoundest mathematician.
There is an extraordinary nebulous
condensation that seems to pervade the entire
space occupied by the stellar constituents of the
group. The stars are swimming in a veritable
sea of luminous cloud. There are filmy tenuous
places, and again condensing whirls of material
doubtless still in the gaseous or plastic stage.
Most noticeable of all are certain almost straight
lines of nebula that connect series of stars. In
one case, shown upon a photograph made by
Henry at Paris, six stars are strung out upon
such a hazy line. We might give play to fancy,
and see in this the result of some vast eruption
of gaseous matter that has already begun to
solidify here and there into stellar nuclei. But
sound science gives not too great freedom to
mere speculative theories. Her duty has been
found in quiet research, and her greatest rewards
have flowed from imaginative speculation, only
when tempered by pure reason.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_POLE-STAR" id="THE_POLE-STAR"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE POLE-STAR</a></h2>


<p>One of the most brilliant observations of the
last few years is Campbell's recent discovery of
the triple character of this star. Centuries and
centuries ago, when astronomy, that venerable
ancient among the sciences, was but an infant,
the pole-star must have been considered the very
oldest of observed heavenly bodies. In the beginning
it was the only sure guide of the navigator
at night, just as to this day it is the foundation-stone
for all observational stellar astronomy
of precision. There has never been a time in
the history of astronomy when the pole-star
might not have been called the most frequently
measured object in the sky of night. So it is
indeed strange that we should find out something
altogether new about it after all these ages
of study.</p>

<p>But the importance of the discovery rests
upon a surer foundation than this. The method<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
by which it has been made is almost a new one
in the science. A generation ago, men thought
the "perfect science," for so we love to call
astronomy, could advance only by increasing a
little the exact precision of observation. The
citadel of perfect truth might be more closely invested;
the forces of science might push forward
step by step; the machinery of research might
be strengthened, but that a new engine of investigation
would be discovered capable of penetrating
where no telescope can ever reach, this, indeed,
seemed far beyond the liveliest hope of
science. Even the discoverer of the spectroscope
could never have dreamed of its possibilities,
could never have foreseen its successes, its
triumphs.</p>

<p>The very name of this instrument suggests
mystery to the popular mind. It is set down at
once among the things too difficult, too intricate,
too abstruse to understand. Yet in its essentials
there is nothing about the spectroscope that cannot
be made clear in a few words. Even the
modern "undulatory theory" of light itself is
terrible only in the length of its name. Any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>one
who has seen the waves of ocean roll, roll,
and ever again roll in upon the shore, can form a
very good notion of how light moves. 'Tis just
such a series of rolling waves; started perhaps
from some brilliant constellation far out upon the
confining bounds of the visible universe, or perhaps
coming from a humble light upon the student's
table; yet it is never anything but a
succession of rolling waves. Only, unlike the
waves of the sea, light waves are all excessively
small. We should call one whose length was a
twenty-thousandth of an inch a big one!</p>

<p>Now the human eye possesses the property of
receiving and understanding these little waves.
The process is an unconscious one. Let but a
set of these tiny waves roll up, as it were, out of
the vast ocean of space and impinge upon the eye,
and all the phenomena of light and color become
what we call "visible." We see the light.</p>

<p>And how does all this find an application in
astronomy? Not to enter too much into technical
details, we may say that the spectroscope is an instrument
which enables us to measure the length
of these light waves, though their length is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
exceedingly small. The day has indeed gone by
when that which poets love to call the Book of
Nature was printed in type that could be read
by the eye unaided. Telescope, microscope, and
spectroscope are essential now to him who would
penetrate any of Nature's secrets. But measurements
with a telescope, like eye observations, are
limited strictly to determining the directions in
which we see the heavenly bodies. Ever since
the beginning of things, when old Hipparchus and
Ulugh Beg made the first rude but successful attempts
to catalogue the stars, the eye and telescope
have been able to measure only such directions.
We aim the telescope at a star, and record the
direction in which it was pointed. Distances in
astronomy can never be measured directly. All
that we know of them has been obtained by calculations
based upon the Newtonian law of gravitation
and observations of directions.</p>

<p>Now the spectroscope seems to offer a sort of
exception to this rule. Suppose we can measure
the wave-lengths of the light sent us from a star.
Suppose again that the star is itself moving swiftly
toward us through space, while continually set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>ting
in motion the waves of light that are ultimately
to reach the waiting astronomer. Evidently
the light waves will be crowded together
somewhat on account of the star's motion. More
waves per second will reach us than would be received
from a star at rest. It is as though the
light waves were compressed or shortened a little.
And if the star is leaving us, instead of coming
nearer, opposite effects will occur. We have then
but to compare spectroscopically starlight with
some artificial source of light in the observatory in
order to find out whether the star is approaching
us or receding from us. And by a simple process
of calculation this stellar motion can be obtained
in miles per second. Thus we can now actually
measure directly, in a certain sense, linear speed
in stellar space, though we are still without the
means of getting directly at stellar distances.</p>

<p>But the most wonderful thing of all about these
spectroscopic measures is the fact that it makes
no difference whatever how far away is the star
under observation. What we learn through the
spectroscope comes from a study of the waves
themselves, and it is of no consequence how far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
they have travelled, or how long they have been
a-coming. For it must not be supposed that
these waves consume no time in passing from a
distant star to our own solar system. It is true
that they move exceeding fast; certainly 180,000
miles per second may be called rapid motion.
But if this cosmic velocity of light is tremendous,
so also are cosmic distances correspondingly vast.
Light needs to move quickly coming from a star,
for even at the rate of motion we have mentioned
it requires many years to reach us from some of
the more distant constellations. It has been well
said that an observer on some far-away star, if
endowed with the power to see at any distance,
however great, might at this moment be looking
on the Crusaders proceeding from Europe against
the Saracen at Jerusalem. For it is quite possible
that not until now has the light which would
make the earth visible had time to reach him.
Yet distant as such an observer might be, light
from the star on which he stood could be measured
in the spectroscope, and would infallibly tell
us whether the earth and star are approaching in
space or gradually drawing farther asunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The pole-star is not one of the more distant
stellar systems. We do not know how far it is
from us very exactly, but certainly not less than
forty or fifty years are necessary for its light to
reach us. The star might have gone out of existence
twenty years ago, and we not yet know
of it, for we would still be receiving the light
which began its long journey to us about 1850 or
1860. But no matter what may be its distance,
Campbell found by careful observations, made in
the latter part of 1896, that the pole-star was then
approaching the earth at the rate of about twelve
miles per second. So far there was nothing especially
remarkable. But in August and September
of the present year twenty-six careful determinations
were made, and these showed that now the
rate of approach varied between about five and
nine miles per second. More astonishing still,
there was a uniform period in the changes of
velocity. In about four days the rate of motion
changed from about five to nine miles and back
again. And this variation kept on with great
regularity. Every successive period of four days
saw a complete cycle of velocity change forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and back between the same limits. There can be
but one reasonable explanation. This star must
be a double, or "binary" star. The two components,
under the influence of powerful mutual
gravitational attraction, must be revolving in a
mighty orbit. Yet this vast orbit, as a whole, with
the two great stars in it, must be approaching our
part of the universe all the time. For the spectroscope
shows the velocity of approach to increase
and diminish, indeed, but it is always present.
Here, then, is this great stellar system, having a
four-day revolution of its own, and yet swinging
rapidly through space in our direction. Nor is
this all. One of the component stars must be
nearly or quite dark; else its presence would infallibly
be detected by our instruments.</p>

<p>And now we come to the most astonishing
thing of all. How comes it that the average
rate of approach of the "four-day system," as a
whole, changed between 1896 and 1899? In
1896 only this velocity of the whole system was
determined, the four-day period remaining undiscovered
until the more numerous observations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>1899. But even without considering the four-day
period, the changing velocity of the entire
system offers one of those problems that exact
science can treat only by the help of the imagination.
There must be some other great centre of
attraction, some cosmic giant, holding the visible
double pole-star under its control. Thus, that
which we see, and call the pole-star, is in reality
threading its path about the third and greatest
member of the system, itself situated in space, we
know not where.</p>

<h2><a name="NEBULAE" id="NEBULAE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">NEBULÆ</a></h2>


<p>Scattered about here and there among the
stars are certain patches of faint luminosity called
by astronomers Nebulæ. These "little clouds"
of filmy light are among the most fascinating of
all the kaleidoscopic phenomena of the heavens;
for it needs but a glance at one of them to give
the impression that here before us is the stuff of
which worlds are made. All our knowledge of
Nature leads us to expect in her finished work
the result of a series of gradual processes of development.
Highly organized phenomena such
as those existing in our solar system did not
spring into perfection in an instant. Influential
forces, easy to imagine, but difficult to define,
must have directed the slow, sure transformation
of elemental matter into sun and planets, things
and men. Therefore a study of those forces
and of their probable action upon nebular
material has always exerted a strong attraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
upon the acutest thinkers among men of exact
science.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the nebulæ is of two kinds&mdash;that
which has been ascertained from observation
as to their appearance, size, distribution, and distance;
and that which is based upon hypotheses
and theoretical reasoning about the condensation
of stellar systems out of nebular masses. It so
happens that our observational material has received
a very important addition quite recently
through the application of photography to the
delineation of nebulæ, and this we shall describe
farther on.</p>

<p>Two nebulæ only are visible to the unaided
eye. The brighter of these is in the constellation
Andromeda; it is of oval or elliptical shape, and
has a distinct central condensation or nucleus.
Upon a photograph by Roberts it appears to
have several concentric rings surrounding the
nebula proper, and gives the general impression
of a flat round disk foreshortened into an oval
shape on account of the observer's position not
being square to the surface of the disk. Very
recent photographs of this nebula, made with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>three-foot reflecting telescope of the Lick Observatory,
bring out the fact that it is really spiral
in form, and that the outlying nebulous rings are
only parts of the spires in a great cosmic whorl.</p>

</div>

<p>This Andromeda nebula is the one in which
the temporary star of 1885 appeared. It blazed
up quite suddenly near the apparent centre of the
nebula, and continued in view for six months,
fading finally beyond the reach of our most
powerful telescopes. There can be little doubt
that the star was actually in the nebula, and not
merely seen through it, though in reality situated
in the extreme outlying part of space at a distance
immeasurably greater than that separating us from
the nebula itself. Such an accidental superposition
of nebula and star might even be due to
sudden incandescence of a new star between us
and the nebula. In such a case we should see
the star projected upon the surface of the nebula,
so that the superposition would be identical with
that actually observed. Therefore, while it is,
indeed, possible that the star may have been either
far behind the nebula or in front of it, we must
accept as more probable the supposition that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
there was a real connection between the two. In
that case there is little doubt that we have actually
observed one of those cataclysms that mark
successive steps of cosmic evolution. We have
no thoroughly satisfactory theory to account for
such an explosive catastrophe within the body of
the nebula itself.</p>

<p>The other naked-eye nebula is in the constellation
Orion. In the telescope it is a more striking
object, perhaps, than the Andromeda nebula;
for it has no well-defined geometrical form, but
consists of an immense odd-shaped mass of light
enclosing and surrounding a number of stars. It
is unquestionably of a very complicated structure,
and is, therefore, less easily studied and explained
than the nebulæ of simpler form. There is no
doubt that the Orion nebula is composed of luminous
gas, and is not merely a cluster of small
stars too numerous and too near together to be
separated from each other, even in our most
powerful telescopes. It was, indeed, supposed,
until about forty years ago, that all the nebulæ
are simply irresolvable star-clusters; but we now
have indisputable evidence, derived from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
spectroscope, that many nebulæ are composed of
true gases, similar to those with which we experiment
in chemical laboratories. This spectroscopic
proof of the gaseous character of nebulæ is
one of the most important discoveries contributed
by that instrument to our small stock of
facts concerning the structure of the sidereal universe.</p>

<p>Coming now to the smaller nebulæ, we find a
great diversity of form and appearance. Some
are ring-shaped, perhaps having a less brilliant
nebulosity within the ring. Many show a central
condensation of disk-like appearance (planetary
nebulæ), or have simply a star at the centre
(nebulous stars). Altogether about ten thousand
such objects have been catalogued by successive
generations of astronomers since the invention of
the telescope, and most of these have been reported
as oval in form. Now we have already
referred to the important addition to our knowledge
of the nebulæ obtained by recent photographic
observations; and this addition consists in
the discovery that most of these oval nebulæ are
in reality spirals. Indeed, it appears that the spiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
type is the normal type, and that nebulæ of irregular
or other forms are exceptions to the general
rule. Even the great Andromeda nebula, as
we have seen, is now recognized as a spiral.</p>

<p>The instrument with which its convolute
structure was discovered is a three-foot reflecting
telescope, made by Common of England, and now
mounted at the Lick Observatory, in California.
The late Professor Keeler devoted much of his
time to photographing nebulæ during the last year
or two. He was able to establish the important
fact just mentioned, that most nebulæ formerly
thought to be mere ovals, turn out to be spiral
when brought under the more searching scrutiny
of the photographic plate applied at the focus of
a telescope of great size, and with an exposure to
the feeble nebular light extending through three
or four consecutive hours.</p>

<p>Many of the spirals have more than a single
volute. It is as though one were to attach a
number of very flexible rods to an axle, like
spokes of a wheel without a rim and then revolve
the axle rapidly. The flexible rods would bend
under the rapid rotation, and form a series of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
spiral curves not unlike many of these nebulæ.
Indeed, it is impossible to escape the conviction
that these great celestial whorls are whirling
around an axis. And it is most important in
the study of the growth of worlds, to recognize
that the type specimen is a revolving spiral.
Therefore, the rotating flattened globe of incandescent
matter postulated by Laplace's nebular
hypothesis would make of our solar system an
exceptional world, and not a type of stellar evolution
in general.</p>

<p>Keeler's photographs have taught us one thing
more. Scarcely is there a single one of his negatives
that does not show nebulæ previously uncatalogued.
It is estimated that if this process of
photography could be extended so as to cover the
entire sky, the whole number of nebulæ would
add up to the stupendous total of 120,000; and
of these the great majority would be spiral.</p>

<p>When we approach the question of the distribution
of nebulæ in different parts of the sky, as
shown by their catalogued positions, we are met
by a curious fact. It appears that the region in
the neighborhood of the Milky Way is espe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>cially
poor in nebulæ, whereas these objects seem
to cluster in much larger numbers about those
points in the sky that are farthest from the
Milky Way. But we know that the Milky
Way is richer in stars than any other part of the
sky, since it is, in fact, made up of stellar bodies
clustered so closely that it is wellnigh impossible
to see between them in the denser portions.
Now, it cannot be the result of chance that the
stars should tend to congregate in the Milky
Way, while the nebulæ tend to seek a position as
far from it as possible. Whatever may be the
cause, we must conclude that the sidereal system,
as we see it, is in general constructed upon a single
plan, and does not consist of a series of universes
scattered at random throughout space. If
we are to suppose that nebulæ turn into stars as
a result of condensation or any other change,
then it is not astonishing to find a minimum of
nebulæ where there is a maximum of stars, since
the nebulæ will have been consumed, as it were,
in the formation of the stars.</p>

<p>It is never advisable to push philosophical
speculation very far when supported by too slender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>a basis of fact. But if we are to regard the
visible universe as made up on the whole of a
single system of bodies, we may well ask one or
two questions to be answered by speculative theory.
We have said the stars are not uniformly
distributed in space. Their concentration in the
Milky Way, forming a narrow band dividing the
sky into two very nearly equal parts, must be
due to their being actually massed in a thin disk
or ring of space within which our solar system is
also situated. This thin disk projected upon the
sky would then appear as the narrow star-band
of the Milky Way. Now, suppose this disk has
an axis perpendicular to itself, and let us imagine
a rotation of the whole sidereal system about
that axis. Then the fact that the visible nebulæ
are congregated far from the Milky Way
means that they are actually near the imaginary
axis.</p>

<p>Possibly the diminished velocity of motion
near the axis may have something to do with
the presence of the nebulæ there. Possibly the
nebulæ themselves have axes perpendicular to
the plane of the Milky Way. If so, we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
see the spiral nebulæ near the Milky Way edgewise,
and those far from it without foreshortening.
Thus, the paucity of nebulæ near the
Milky Way may be due in part to the increased
difficulty of seeing them when looked at edgewise.
Indeed, there is no limit to the possibilities
of hypothetical reasoning about the nebular
structure of our universe; unfortunately, the
whole question must be placed for the present
among those intensely interesting cosmic problems
awaiting elucidation, let us hope, in this
new century.</p>

<h2><a name="TEMPORARY_STARS" id="TEMPORARY_STARS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">TEMPORARY STARS</a></h2>


<p>Nothing can be more erroneous than to suppose
that the stellar multitude has continued unchanged
throughout all generations of men.
"Eternal fires" poets have called the stars; yet
they burn like any little conflagration on the
earth; now flashing with energy, brilliant, incandescent,
and again sinking into the dull glow of
smouldering half-burned ashes. It is even probable
that space contains many darkened orbs, stars
that may have risen in constellations to adorn
the skies of prehistoric time&mdash;now cold, unseen,
unknown. So far from dealing with an unvarying
universe, it is safe to say that sidereal
astronomy can advance only by the discovery of
change. Observational science watches with untiring
industry, and night hides few celestial events
from the ardent scrutiny of astronomers. Old
theories are tested and newer ones often perfected
by the detection of some slight and previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
unsuspected alteration upon the face of the sky.
The interpretation of such changes is the most
difficult task of science; it has taxed the acutest
intellects among men throughout all time.</p>

<p>If, then, changes can be seen among the stars,
what are we to think of the most important change
of all, the blazing into life of a new stellar system?
Fifteen times since men began to write their
records of the skies has the birth of a star been
seen. Surely we may use this term when we
speak of the sudden appearance of a brilliant luminary
where nothing visible existed before. But
we shall see further on that scientific considerations
make it highly probable that the phenomenon
in question does not really involve the creation
of new matter. It is old material becoming
suddenly luminous for some hidden reason. In
fact, whenever a new object of great brilliancy has
been discovered, it has been found to lose its light
again quite soon, ending either in total extinction
or at least in comparative darkness. It is for this
reason that the name "temporary star" has been
applied to cases of this kind.</p>

<p>The first authenticated instance dates from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
year 134 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, when a new star appeared in the
constellation Scorpio. It was this star that led
Hipparchus to construct his stellar catalogue, the
first ever made. It occurred to him, of course,
that there could be but one way to make sure in
the future that any given object discovered in the
sky was new; it was necessary to make a complete
list of everything visible in his day. Later
astronomers need then only compare Hipparchus's
catalogue with the heavens from time to
time in order to find out whether anything unknown
had appeared. This work of Hipparchus
became the foundation of sidereal study, and led
to most important discoveries of various kinds.</p>

<p>But no records remain concerning his new star
except the bare fact of its appearance in Scorpio.
Hipparchus's published works are all lost. We
do not even know the exact place of his birth,
and as for those two dates of entry and exit that
history attaches to great names&mdash;we have them
not. Yet he was easily the first astronomer of
antiquity, one of the first of all time; and we
know of him only from the writings of Ptolemy,
who lived three hundred years after him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>More than five centuries elapsed before another
temporary star was entered in the records of
astronomy. This happened in the year 389 <span class="fs70">A.D.</span>,
when a star appeared in Aquila; and of this one
also we know nothing further. But about twelve
centuries later, in November, 1572, a new and
brilliant object was found in the constellation
Cassiopeia. It is known as Tycho's star, since it
was the means of winning for astronomy a man
who will always take high rank in her annals,
Tycho Brahe, of Denmark. When he first saw
this star, it was already very bright, equalling even
Venus at her best; and he continued a careful
series of observations for sixteen months, when it
faded finally from his view. The position of the
new star was measured with reference to other stars
in the constellation Cassiopeia, and the results of
Tycho's observations were finally published by
him in the year 1573. It appears that much urging
on the part of friends was necessary to induce
him to consent to this publication, not because of
a modest reluctance to rush into print, but for the
reason that he considered it undignified for a nobleman
of Denmark to be the author of a book!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>An important question in cosmic astronomy is
opened by Tycho's star. Did it really disappear
from the heavens when he saw it no more, or had
its lustre simply been reduced below the visual
power of the unaided eye? Unfortunately,
Tycho's observations of the star's position in the
constellation were necessarily crude. He possessed
no instruments of precision such as we now
have at our disposal, and so his work gives us
only a rather rough approximation of the true
place of the star. A small circle might be imagined
on the sky of a size comparable with the
possible errors of Tycho's observations. We
could then say with certainty that his star must
have been situated somewhere within that little
circle, but it is impossible to know exactly where.</p>

<p>It happens that our modern telescopes reveal
the existence of several faint stars within the
space covered by such a circle. Any one of these
would have been too small for Tycho to see, and,
therefore, any one of them may be his once brilliant
luminary reduced to a state of permanent or temporary
semi-darkness. These considerations are,
indeed, of great importance in explaining the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
phenomena of temporary stars. If Tycho had
been able to leave us a more exact determination
of his star's place in the sky, and even if our most
powerful instruments could not show anything in
that place to-day, we might nevertheless theorize
on the supposition that the object still exists, but
has reached a condition almost entirely dark.</p>

<p>Indeed, the latest theory classes temporary stars
among those known as variable. For many stars
are known to undergo quite decided changes in
brilliancy; possibly inconstancy of light is the rule
rather than the exception. But while such changes,
when they exist, are too small to be perceptible
in most cases, there is certainly a large number of
observable variables, subject to easily measurable
alterations of light. Astronomers prefer to see in
the phenomena of temporary stars simple cases of
variation in which the increase of light is sudden,
and followed by a gradual diminution. Possibly
there is then a long period of comparative or even
complete darkness, to be followed as before by a
sudden blazing up and extinction. No temporary
star, however, has been observed to reappear in the
same celestial place where once had glowed its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
sudden outburst. But cases are not wanting
where incandescence has been both preceded and
followed by a continued existence, visible though
not brilliant.</p>

<p>For such cases as these it is necessary to come
down to modern records. We cannot be sure
that some faint star has been temporarily brilliant,
unless we actually see the conflagration itself, or
are able to make the identity of the object's precise
location in the sky before and after the event
perfectly certain by the aid of modern instruments
of precision. But no one has ever seen
the smouldering fires break out. Temporary
stars have always been first noticed only after
having been active for hours if not for days. So
we must perforce fall back on instrumental identification
by determinations of the star's exact
position upon the celestial vault.</p>

<p>Some time between May 10th and 12th in the
year 1866 the ninth star in the list of known
"temporaries" appeared. It possessed very
great light-giving power, being surpassed in brilliancy
by only about a score of stars in all the
heavens. It retained a maximum luminosity only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
three or four days, and in less than two months
had diminished to a point somewhere between the
ninth and tenth "magnitudes." In other words,
from a conspicuous star, visible to the naked eye,
it had passed beyond the power of anything less
than a good telescope. Fortunately, we had excellent
star-catalogues before 1866. These were
at once searched, and it was possible to settle
quite definitely that a star of about the ninth or
tenth magnitude had really existed before 1866
at precisely the same point occupied by the new
one. Needless to say, observations were made of
the new star itself, and afterward compared with
later observations of the faint one that still occupies
its place. These render quite certain the
identity of the temporary bright star with the
faint ones that preceded and followed it.</p>

<p>Such results, on the one hand, offer an excellent
vindication of the painstaking labor expended
on the construction of star-catalogues, and, on the
other, serve to elucidate the mystery of temporary
stars. Nothing can be more plausible than
to explain by analogy those cases in which no
previous or subsequent existence has been ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>served.
It is merely necessary to suppose that,
instead of varying from the ninth or tenth magnitude,
other temporary objects have begun and
ended with the twentieth; for the twentieth magnitude
would be beyond the power of our best
instruments.</p>

<p>Nor is the star of 1866 an isolated instance.
Ten years later, in 1876, a temporary star blazed
up to about the second magnitude, and returned
to invisibility, so far as the naked eye is concerned,
within a month, having retained its greatest brilliancy
only one or two days. This star is still
visible as a tiny point of light, estimated to be of
the fifteenth magnitude. Whether it existed
prior to its sudden outburst can never be known,
because we do not possess catalogues including
the generality of stars as faint as this one must
have been. But at all events, the continued existence
of the object helps to place the temporary
stars in the class of variables.</p>

<p>The next star, already mentioned under "nebula,"
was first seen in 1885. It was in one respect
the most remarkable of all, for it appeared
almost in the centre of the great nebula in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
constellation Andromeda. It was never very
bright, reaching only the sixth magnitude or
thereabouts, was observed during a period of only
six months, and at the end of that time had faded
beyond the reach of our most powerful glasses.
It is a most impressive fact that this event occurred
within the nebula. Whatever may be the
nature of the explosive catastrophe to which the
temporary stars owe their origin, we can now say
with certainty that not even those vast elemental
luminous clouds men call nebulæ are free from
danger.</p>

<p>The last outburst on our records was first noticed
February 22, 1901. The star appeared in
the constellation Perseus, and soon reached the
first magnitude, surpassing almost every other
star in the sky. It has been especially remarkable
in that it has become surrounded by a nebulous
mass in which are several bright condensations
or nuclei; and these seem to be in very
rapid motion. The star is still under observation
(January, 1902).</p>

<h2><a name="GALILEO" id="GALILEO"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">GALILEO</a></h2>


<p>Among the figures that stand out sharply
upon the dim background of old-time science,
there is none that excites a keener interest than
Galileo. Most people know him only as a distinguished
man of learning; one who carried on
a vigorous controversy with the Church on matters
scientific. It requires some little study,
some careful reading between the lines of astronomical
history, to gain acquaintance with the
man himself. He had a brilliant, incisive wit;
was a genuine humorist; knew well and loved
the amusing side of things; and could not often
forego a sarcastic pleasantry, or deny himself the
pleasure of argument. Yet it is more than
doubtful if he ever intended impertinence, or
gave willingly any cause of quarrel to the
Church.</p>

<p>His acute understanding must have seen that
there exists no real conflict between science and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
religion; for time, in passing, has made common
knowledge of this truth, as it has of many things
once hidden. When we consider events that occurred
three centuries ago, it is easy to replace
excited argument with cool judgment; to remember
that those were days of violence and
cruelty; that public ignorance was of a density
difficult to imagine to-day; and that it was universally
considered the duty of the Church to
assume an authoritative attitude upon many
questions with which she is not now required to
concern herself in the least. Charlatans, unbalanced
theorists, purveyors of scientific marvels,
were all liable to be passed upon definitely by
the Church, not in a spirit of impertinent interference,
but simply as part of her regular duties.</p>

<p>If the Church's judgment in such matters was
sometimes erroneous; if her interference now
and again was cruel, the cause must be sought in
the manners and customs of the time, when persecution
rioted in company with ignorance, and
violence was the law. Perhaps even to-day it
would not be amiss to have a modern scientific
board pass authoritatively upon novel discov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>eries
and inventions, so as to protect the public
against impostors as the Church tried to do of
old.</p>

<p>Galileo was born at Pisa in 1564, and his long
life lasted until 1642, the very year of Newton's
birth. His most important scientific discoveries
may be summed up in a few words; he was the
first to use a telescope for examining the heavenly
bodies; he discovered mountains on the
moon; the satellites of Jupiter; the peculiar
appearance of Saturn which Huygens afterward
explained as a ring surrounding the ball of the
planet; and, finally, he found black spots on the
sun's disk. These discoveries, together with his
remarkable researches in mechanical science, constitute
Galileo's claim to immortality as an investigator.
But, as we have said, it is not our
intention to consider his work as a series of scientific
discoveries. We shall take a more interesting
point of view, and deal with him rather as
a human being who had contracted the habit of
making scientific researches.</p>

<p>What must have been his feelings when he
first found with his "new" telescope the satel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>lites
of Jupiter? They were seen on the night
of January 7, 1610. He had already viewed the
planet through his earlier and less powerful
glass, and was aware that it possessed a round
disk like the moon, only smaller. Now he saw
also three objects that he took to be little stars
near the planet. But on the following night, as
he says, "drawn by what fate I know not," the
tube was again turned upon the planet. The
three small stars had changed their positions, and
were now all situated to the west of Jupiter,
whereas on the previous night two had been on
the eastern side. He could not explain this
phenomenon, but he recognized that there was
something peculiar at work. Long afterward, in
one of his later works, translated into quaint old
English by Salusbury, he declared that "one sole
experiment sufficeth to batter to the ground a
thousand probable Arguments." This was already
the guiding principle of his scientific activity,
a principle of incomparable importance, and
generally credited to Bacon. Needless to say,
Jupiter was now examined every night.</p>

<p>The 9th was cloudy, but on the 10th he again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
saw his little stars, their number now reduced to
two. He guessed that the third was behind the
planet's disk. The position of the two visible
ones was altogether different from either of the
previous observations. On the 11th he became
sure that what he saw was really a series of satellites
accompanying Jupiter on his journey
through space, and at the same time revolving
around him. On the 12th, at 3 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span>, he actually
saw one of the small objects emerge from
behind the planet; and on the 13th he finally
saw four satellites. Two hundred and eighty-two
years were destined to pass away before any
human eye should see a fifth. It was Barnard in
1892 who followed Galileo.</p>

<p>To understand the effect of this discovery
upon Galileo requires a person who has himself
watched the stars, not, as a dilettante, seeking
recreation or amusement, but with that deep reverence
that comes only to him who feels&mdash;nay,
knows&mdash;that in the moment of observation just
passed he too has added his mite to the great
fund of human knowledge. Galileo's mummied
forefinger still points toward the stars from its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
little pedestal of wood in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Museo</i> at Florence,
a sign to all men that he is unforgotten. But
Galileo knew on that 11th of January, 1610, that
the memory of him would never fade; that the
very music of the spheres would thenceforward
be attuned to a truer note, if any would but
hearken to the Jovian harmony. For he recognized
at once that the visible revolution of these
moons around Jupiter, while that planet was
himself visibly travelling through space, must
deal its death-blow to the old Ptolemaic system
of the universe. Here was a great planet, the
centre of a system of satellites, and yet not
the centre of the universe. Surely, then, the
earth, too, might be a mere planet like Jupiter,
and not the supposed motionless centre of all
things.</p>

<p>The satellite discovery was published in 1610
in a little book called "Sidereus Nuncius," usually
translated "The Sidereal Messenger." It seems
to us, however, that the word "messenger" is
not strong enough; surely in Papal Italy a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuncius</i>
was more than a mere messenger. He was
clothed with the very highest authority, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
think it probable that Galileo's choice of this
word in the title of his book means that he
claimed for himself similar authority in science.
At all events, the book made him at once a great
reputation and numerous enemies.</p>

<p>But it was not until 1616 that the Holy Office
(Inquisition) issued an edict ordering Galileo to
abandon his opinion that the earth moved, and at
the same time placed Copernicus's <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Revolutionibus</cite>
and two other books advocating that doctrine
on the "Index Librorum Prohibitorum,"
or list of books forbidden by the Church. These
volumes remained in subsequent editions of the
"Index" down to 1821, but they no longer
appear in the edition in force to-day.</p>

<p>Galileo's most characteristic work is entitled
the "Dialogue on the Two Chief Systems of the
World." It was not published until 1632,
although the idea of the book was conceived
many years earlier. In it he gave full play to his
extraordinary powers as a true humorist, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fine
lame</i> among controversialists, and a genuine
man of science, valuing naked truth above all
other things. As may be imagined, it was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
small matter to obtain the authorities' consent to
this publication. Galileo was already known to
hold heretical opinions, and it was suspected that
he had not laid them aside when commanded to
do so by the edict of 1616. But perhaps Galileo's
introduction to the "Dialogue" secured the
censor's <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imprimatur</i>; it is even suspected that
the Roman authorities helped in the preparation
of this introduction. Fortunately, we have a delightful
contemporary translation into English,
by Thomas Salusbury, printed at London by
Leybourne in 1661. We have already quoted
from this translation, and now add from the same
work part of Galileo's masterly preface to the
"Dialogue":</p>

<p>"Judicious reader, there was published some
years since in <em>Rome</em> a salutiferous Edict, that, for
the obviating of the dangerous Scandals of the
Present Age, imposed a reasonable Silence upon
the Pythagorean (Copernican) opinion of the
Mobility of the Earth. There want not such
as unadvisedly affirm, that the Decree was not
the production of a sober Scrutiny, but of an
ill-formed passion; and one may hear some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
mutter that Consultors altogether ignorant of
Astronomical observations ought not to clipp
the wings of speculative wits with rash prohibitions."</p>

<p>Galileo first states his own views, and then
pretends that he will oppose them. He goes on
to say that he believes in the earth's immobility,
and takes "the contrary only for a mathematical
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Capriccio</i>," as he calls it; something to be considered,
because possessing an academical interest,
but on no account having a real existence. Of
course any one (even a censor) ought to be able
to see that it is the Capriccio, and not its opposite,
that Galileo really advocates. Three persons
appear in the "Dialogue": Salviati, who believes
in the Copernican system; Simplicio, of
suggestive name, who thinks the earth cannot
move; and, finally, Sagredus, a neutral gentleman
of humorous propensities, who usually begins
by opposing Salviati, but ends by being convinced.
He then helps to punish poor Simplicio,
who is one of those persons apparently incapable
of comprehending a reasonable argument. Here
is an interesting specimen of the "Dialogue"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
taken from Salusbury's translation: Salviati refers
to the argument, then well known, that the earth
cannot rotate on its axis, "because of the impossibility
of its moving long without wearinesse."
Sagredus replies: "There are some kinds of
animals which refresh themselves after wearinesse
by rowling on the earth; and that therefore there
is no need to fear that the Terrestrial Globe
should tire, nay, it may be reasonably affirmed
that it enjoyeth a perpetual and most tranquil repose,
keeping itself in an eternal rowling." Salviati's
comment on this sally is, "You are too
tart and satyrical, Sagredus."</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the "Dialogue" finished
the Ptolemaic theory, and made that of
Copernicus the only possible one. At all events,
it brought about the well-known attack upon
Galileo from the authorities of the Holy Office.
We shall not recount the often-told tale of his
recantation. He was convicted (very rightly) of
being a Copernican, and was forced to abjure that
doctrine. Galileo's life may be summed up as
one of those through which the world has been
made richer. A clean-cutting analytic wit, never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
becoming dull: heated again and again in the
fierce blaze of controversy, it was allowed to cool
only that it might acquire a finer temper, to
pierce with fatal certainty the smallest imperfections
in the armor of his adversaries.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PLANET_OF_1898" id="THE_PLANET_OF_1898"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE PLANET OF 1898</a></h2>


<p>The discovery of a new and important planet
usually receives more immediate popular attention
and applause than any other astronomical
event. Philosophers are fond of referring to our
solar system as a mere atom among the countless
universes that seem to be suspended within the
profound depths of space. They are wont to
point out that this solar system, small and insignificant
as a whole in comparison with many
of the stellar worlds, is, nevertheless, made up of
a large number of constituent planets; and these
in turn are often accompanied with still smaller
satellites, or moons. Thus does Nature provide
worlds within worlds, and it is not surprising
that public attention should be at once attracted
by any new member of our sun's own special
family of planets. The ancients were acquainted
with only five of the bodies now counted as
planets, viz.: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
and Saturn. The dates of their discovery are
lost in antiquity. To these Uranus was added
in 1781 by a brilliant effort of the elder Herschel.
We are told that intense popular excitement
followed the announcement of Herschel's first
observation: he was knighted and otherwise
honored by the English King, and was enabled
to lay a secure foundation for the future distinguished
astronomical reputation of his family.</p>

<p>Herschel's discovery quickened the restless
activity of astronomers. Persistent efforts were
made to sift the heavens more and more closely,
with the strengthened hope of adding still further
to our planetary knowledge. An association
of twenty-four enthusiastic German astronomers
was formed for the express purpose of hunting
planets. But it fell to the lot of an Italian,
Piazzi, of Palermo, to find the first of that
series of small bodies now known as the asteroids
or minor planets. He made the discovery at the
very beginning of our century, January 1, 1801.</p>

<p>But news travelled slowly in those days, and it
was not until nearly April that the German observers
heard from Piazzi. In the meantime, he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
himself been prevented by illness from continuing
his observations. Unfortunately, the planet
had by this time moved so near the sun, on account
of its own motions and those of the earth,
that it could no longer be observed. The bright
light of the sun made observations of the new
body impossible; and it was feared that, owing
to lack of knowledge of the planet's orbit, astronomers
would be unable to trace it. So there
seemed, indeed, to be danger of an almost irreparable
loss to science. But in scientific, as in
other human emergencies, someone always appears
at the proper moment. A very young
mathematician at Göttingen, named Gauss, attacked
the problem, and was able to devise a
method of predicting the future course of the
planet on the sky, using only the few observations
made by Piazzi himself. Up to that time
no one had attempted to compute a planetary
orbit, unless he had at his disposal a series of
observations extending throughout the whole
period of the planet's revolution around the sun.
But the Piazzi planet offered a new problem in
astronomy. It had become imperatively neces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>sary
to obtain an orbit from a few observations
made at nearly the same date. Gauss's work was
signally triumphant, for the planet was actually
found in the position predicted by him, as soon
as a change in the relative places of the planet
and earth permitted suitable observations to be
made.</p>

<p>But after all, Piazzi's planet belongs to a class
of quite small bodies, and is by no means as interesting
as Herschel's discovery, Uranus. Yet
even this must be relegated to second rank
among planetary discoveries. On September 23,
1846, the telescope of the Berlin Observatory
was directed to a certain point on the sky for a
very special reason. Galle, the astronomer of
Berlin, had received a letter from Leverrier, of
Paris, telling him that if he would look in a certain
direction he would detect a new and large planet.</p>

<p>Leverrier's information was based upon a mathematical
calculation. Seated in his study, with
no instruments but pen and paper, he had slowly
figured out the history of a world as yet unseen.
Tiny discrepancies existed in the observed
motions of Herschel's planet Uranus. No man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
had explained their cause. To Leverrier's acute
understanding they slowly shaped themselves
into the possible effects of attraction emanating
from some unknown planet exterior to Uranus.
Was it conceivable that these slight tremulous
imperfections in the motion of a planet could be
explained in this way? Leverrier was able to
say confidently, "Yes." But we may rest assured
that Galle had but small hopes that upon
his eye first, of all the myriad eyes of men, would
fall a ray of the new planet's light. Careful
and methodical, he would neglect no chance of
advancing his beloved science. He would look.</p>

<p>Only one who has himself often seen the morning's
sunrise put an end to a night's observation
of the stars can hope to appreciate what Galle's
feelings must have been when he saw the planet.
To his trained eye it was certainly recognizable
at once. And then the good news was sent on
to Paris. We can imagine Leverrier, the cool
calculator, saying to himself: "Of course he
found it. It was a mathematical certainty."
Nevertheless, his satisfaction must have been
of the keenest. No triumphs give a pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
higher than those of the intellect. Let no one
imagine that men who make researches in the
domain of pure science are under-paid. They
find their reward in pleasure that is beyond any
price.</p>

<p>The Leverrier planet was found to be the last
of the so-called major planets, so far as we can
say in the present state of science. It received
the name Neptune. Observers have found no
other member of the solar system comparable in
size with such bodies as Uranus and Neptune.
More than one eager mathematician has tried to
repeat Leverrier's achievement, but the supposed
planet was not found. It has been said that figures
never lie; yet such is the case only when
the computations are correctly made. People
are prone to give to the work of careless or incompetent
mathematicians the same degree of
credence that is really due only to masters of the
craft. It requires the test of time to affix to any
man's work the stamp of true genius.</p>

<p>While, then, we have found no more large
planets, quite a group of companions to Piazzi's
little one have been discovered. They are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
small, probably never exceeding about 400 miles
in diameter. All travel around the sun in orbits
that lie wholly within that of Jupiter and are exterior
to that of Mars. The introduction of astronomical
photography has given a tremendous
impetus to the discovery of these minor planets,
as they are called. It is quite interesting to examine
the photographic process by which such
discoveries are made possible and even easy.
The matter will not be difficult to understand if
we remember that all the planets are continually
changing their places among the other stars. For
the planets travel around the sun at a comparatively
small distance. The great majority of the
stars, on the contrary, are separated from the sun
by an almost immeasurable space. As a result,
they do not seem to move at all among themselves,
and so we call them fixed stars: they may,
indeed, be in motion, but their great distance prevents
our detecting it in a short period of time.</p>

<p>Now, stellar photographs are made in much
the same way as ordinary portraits. Only, instead
of using a simple camera, the astronomer
exposes his photographic plate at the eye-end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
a telescope. The sensitive surface of the plate is
substituted for the human eye. We then find
on the picture a little dot corresponding to every
star within the photographed region of the sky.
But, as everyone knows, the turning of the
earth on its axis makes the whole heavens, including
the sun, moon, and stars, rise and set
every day. So the stars, when we photograph
them, are sure to be either climbing up in the
eastern sky or else slowly creeping down in the
western. And that makes astronomical photography
very different from ordinary portrait work.</p>

<p>The stars correspond to the sitter, but they
don't sit still. For this reason it is necessary to
connect the telescope with a mechanical contrivance
which makes it turn round like the hour-hand
of an ordinary clock. The arrangement is
so adjusted that the telescope, once aimed at the
proper object in the sky, will move so as to remain
pointed exactly the same during the whole
time of the photographic exposure. Thus, while
the light of any star is acting on the plate, such
action will be continuous at a single point.
Consequently, the finished picture will show the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
star as a little dot; while without this arrangement,
the star would trail out into a line instead
of a dot. Now we have seen that the
planets are all moving slowly among the fixed
stars. So if we make a star photograph in a part
of the sky where a planet happens to be, the
planet will make a short line on the plate;
whereas, if the planet remained quite unmoved
relatively to the stars it would give a dot like
the star dots. The presence of a line, therefore,
at once indicates a planet.</p>

<p>This method of planet-hunting has proved
most useful. More than 400 small planets similar
to Piazzi's have been found, though never
another one like Uranus and Neptune. As
we have said, all these little bodies lie between
Mars and Jupiter. They evidently belong to a
group or family, and many astronomers have
been led to believe that they are but fragments
of a former large planet.</p>

<p>In August, 1898, however, one was found by
Witt, of Berlin, which will probably occupy a
very prominent place in the annals of astronomy.
For this planet goes well within the orbit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Mars, and this will bring it at times very close
to the earth. In fact, when the motions of the
new planet and the earth combine to bring them
to their positions of greatest proximity, the new
planet will approach us closer than any other
celestial body except our own moon. Witt
named his new planet Eros. Its size, though
small, may prove to be sufficient to bring it within
the possibilities of naked-eye observation at the
time of closest approach to the earth.</p>

<p>To astronomers the great importance of this
new planet is due to the following circumstance:
For certain reasons too technical to be stated
here in detail, the distance from the earth to any
planet can be determined with a degree of precision
which is greatest for planets that are near
us. Thus in time we shall learn the distance of
Eros more accurately than we know any other
celestial distance. From this, by a process of
calculation, the solar distance from the earth is
determinable. But the distance from earth to
sun is the fundamental astronomical unit of measure;
so that Witt's discovery, through its effect
on the unit of measure, will doubtless influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
every part of the science of astronomy. Here
we have once more a striking instance of the
reward sure to overtake the diligent worker in
science&mdash;a whole generation of men will doubtless
pass away before we shall have exhausted
the scientific advantages to be drawn from Witt's
remarkable observation of 1898.</p>

<p>Long before clocks and watches had been invented,
people began to measure time with sun-dials.
Nowadays, when almost everyone has a
watch in his pocket, and can have a clock, too,
on the mantel-piece of every room in the house,
the sun-dial has ceased to be needed in ordinary
life. But it is still just as interesting as ever to
anyone who would like to have the means of
getting time direct from the sun, the great hour-hand
or timekeeper of the sky. Any person
who is handy with tools can make a sun-dial
quite easily, by following the directions given
below.</p>

<p>In the first place, you must know that the
sun-dial gives the time by means of the sun's
shadow. If you stick a walking-cane up in the
sand on a bright, sunshiny day, the cane has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
long shadow that looks like a dark line on the
ground. Now if you watch this shadow carefully,
you will see that it does not stay in the
same place all day. Slowly but surely, as the
sun climbs up in the sky, the shadow creeps
around the cane. You can see quite easily that
if the cane were fastened in a board floor, and if
we could mark on the floor the places where the
shadow was at different hours of the day, we
could make the shadow tell us the time just like
the hour-hand of a clock. A sun-dial is just
such an arrangement as this, and I will show you
how to mark the shadow places exactly, so as to
tell the right time without any trouble whenever
the sun shines.</p>

<p>If you were to watch very carefully such an
arrangement as a cane standing in a board floor,
you would not find the creeping shadow in just
the same place at the same time every day. If
you marked the place of the shadow at exactly
ten o'clock by your watch some morning, and
then went back another day at ten, you would
not find the shadow on the old mark. It would
not get very far from it in a day or two, but in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
month or so it would be quite a distance away.
Now, of course, a sun-dial would be of no use if
it did not tell the time correctly every day; and
in fact, it is not easy to make a dial when the
shadow is cast by a stick standing straight up.
But we can get over this difficulty very well by
letting the shadow be cast by a stick that leans
over toward the floor just the right amount, as I
will explain in a moment. Of course, we should
not really use the floor for our sun-dial. It is
much better to mark out the hour-lines, as they
are called, on a smooth piece of ordinary white
board, and then, after the dial is finished, it can
be screwed down to a piazza floor or railing, or it
can be fastened on a window-sill. It ought to
be put in a place where the sun can get at it
most of the time, because, of course, you cannot
use the sun-dial when the sun is not shining on
it. If the dial is set on a window-sill (of a city
house, for instance) you must choose a south
window if you can, so as to get the sun nearly all
day. If you have to take an east window, you
can use the dial in the morning only, and in a
west window only in the afternoon. Sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
it is best not to try to fasten the dial to its
support with screws, but just to mark its place,
and then set it out whenever you want to use
it. For if the dial is made of wood, and not
painted, it might be injured by rain or snow
in bad weather if left out on a window-sill or
piazza.</p>

<div class="caption">

</div>

<p>It is not quite easy to fasten a little stick to a
board so that it will lean over just right. So it
is better not to use a stick or a cane in the way
I have described, but instead to use a piece of
board cut to just the right shape.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 shows what a sun-dial should look like.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
The lines to show the shadow's place at the different
hours of the day will be marked on the
board ABCD, and this will
be put flat on the window-sill
or piazza floor. The three-cornered
piece of board <em>abc</em>
is fastened to the bottom-board
ABCD by screws going
through ABCD from underneath. The edge <em>ab</em>
of the three-cornered board <em>abc</em> then takes the
place of the leaning stick or cane, and the time is
marked by the shadow cast by the edge <em>ab</em>. Of
course, it is important that this edge should be
straight and perfectly flat and even. If you are
handy with tools, you can make it quite easily,
but if not, you can mark the right shape on a
piece of paper very carefully, and take it to a
carpenter, who can cut the board according to
the pattern you have marked on the paper.</p>

<img src="images/i_073.jpg" width="200" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Fig. 2.</div>
</div>

<p>Now I must tell you how to draw the shape
of the three-cornered board <em>abc</em>. Fig. 2 shows
how it is done. The side <em>ac</em> should always be
just five inches long. The side <em>bc</em> is drawn at
right angles to <em>ac</em>, which you can do with an or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>dinary
carpenter's square. The length of <em>bc</em> depends
on the place for which the dial is made.
The following table gives the length of <em>bc</em> for
various places in the United States, and, after you
have marked out the length of <em>bc</em>, it is only
necessary to complete the three-cornered piece by
drawing the side <em>ab</em> from <em>a</em> to <em>b</em>.</p>

<p>If you wish to make a dial for a place not given
in the table, it will be near enough to use the distance
<em>bc</em> as given for the place nearest to you.
But in selecting the nearest place from the table,
please remember to take that one of the cities
mentioned which is nearest to you in a north-and-south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
direction. It does not matter how far away
the place is in an east-and-west direction. So, instead
of taking the place that is nearest to you on
the map in a straight line, take the place to which
you could travel by going principally east or west,
and very little north or south. The figure drawn
is about the right shape for New York. The
board used for the three-cornered piece should be
about one-half inch thick. But if you are making
a window-sill dial, you may prefer to have it
smaller than I have described. You can easily
have it half as big by making all the sizes and
lines in half-inches where the table calls for
inches.</p>

<p>After you have marked out the dimensions for
the three-cornered piece that is to throw the
shadow, you can prepare the dial itself, with the
lines that mark the place of the shadow for every
hour of the day. This you can do in the manner
shown in Fig. 3. Just as in the case of the three-cornered
piece, you can draw the dial with a pencil
directly on a smooth piece of white board, about
three-quarters of an inch thick, or you can mark
it out on a paper pattern and transfer it afterward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to the board. Perhaps it will be as well to begin
by drawing on paper, as any mistakes can then
be corrected before you commence to mark your
wood.</p>

<img src="images/i_076.jpg" width="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Fig. 3.</div>
</div>

<p>In the first place you must draw a couple of
lines MN and M′N′, eight inches long, and just
far enough apart to fit the edge of your three-cornered
shadow-piece. You will remember I
told you to make that one-half inch thick, so
your two lines will also be one-half inch apart.
Now draw the two lines NO and N′O′ square<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with MN and M′N′, and make the distances
NO and N′O′ just five inches each. The lines
OK, O′K′, and the other lines forming the outer
border of the dial, are then drawn just as shown,
OK and O′K′ being just eight inches long, the
same as MN and M′N′. The lower lines in
the figure, which are not very important, are to
complete the squares. You must mark the lines
NO and N′O′ with the figures VI, these being
the lines reached by the shadow at six o'clock in
the morning and evening. The points where the
VII, VIII, and other hour-lines cut the lines
OK, O′K′, MK, and M′K′ can be found from
the table on <a href="#Page_78">page 78</a>.</p>

<p>In using the table you will notice that the line
IX falls sometimes on one side of the corner K,
and sometimes on the other. Thus for Albany
the line passes seven and seven-sixteenth inches
from O, while for Charleston it passes four and
three-eighth inches from M. For Baltimore it
passes exactly through the corner K.</p>

<p>The distance for the line marked V from O′ is
just the same as the distance from O to VII.
Similarly, IV corresponds to VIII, III to IX,
II to X, and I to XI. The number XII is
marked at MM′ as shown. If you desire to add
lines (not shown in Fig. 3 to avoid confusion) for
hours earlier than six in the morning, it is merely
necessary to mark off a distance on the line KO,
below the point O, and equal to the distance from
O to VII. This will give the point where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
5 <span class="fs70">A.M.</span> shadow line drawn from N cuts the line
KO. A corresponding line for 7 <span class="fs70">P.M.</span> can be
drawn from N′ on the other side of the figure.</p>

<p>After you have marked out the dial very carefully,
you must fasten the three-cornered shadow-piece
to it in such a way that the whole instrument
will look like <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>. The edge <em>ac</em> (Fig.
2) goes on NM (Fig. 3). The point <em>a</em> (Fig. 2)
must come exactly on N (Fig. 3); and as the
lines NM (Fig. 3) and N′M′ (Fig. 3) have been
made just the right distance apart to fit the
thickness of the three-cornered piece <em>abc</em> (Fig.
2), everything will go together just right. The
point <em>c</em> (Fig. 2) will not quite reach to M (Fig. 3),
but will be on the line NM (Fig. 3) at a distance
of three inches from M. The two pieces of
wood will be fastened together with three screws
going through the bottom-board ABCD (Figs.
1 and 3) and into the edge <em>ac</em> (Fig. 2) of the
three-cornered piece. The whole instrument will
then look something like <a href="#FIG_1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<p>After you have got your sun-dial put together,
you need only set it in the sun in a level place,
on a piazza or window-sill, and turn it round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
until it tells the right time by the shadow. You
can get your local time from a watch near enough
for setting up the dial. Once the dial is set right
you can screw it down or mark its position, and
it will continue to give correct solar time every
day in the year.</p>

<p>If you wish to adjust the dial very closely,
you must go out some fine day and note the error
of the dial by a watch at about ten in the
morning, and at noon, and again at about two in
the afternoon. If the error is the same each time,
the dial is rightly set. If not, you must try, by
turning the dial slightly, to get it so placed that
your three errors will be nearly the same. When
you have got them as nearly alike as you can, the
dial will be sufficiently near right. The solar or
dial time may, however, differ somewhat from
ordinary watch time, but the difference will never
be great enough to matter, when we remember
that sun-dials are only rough timekeepers after
all, and useful principally for amusement.</p>

<h2><a name="PHOTOGRAPHY_IN_ASTRONOMY" id="PHOTOGRAPHY_IN_ASTRONOMY"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">PHOTOGRAPHY IN ASTRONOMY</a></h2>


<p>New highways of science have been monumented
now and again by the masterful efforts of
genius, working single-handed; but more often
it is slow-moving time that ripens discovery, and,
at the proper moment, opens some new path to
men whose intellectual power is but willingness
to learn. So the annals of astronomical photography
do not recount the achievements of extraordinary
genius. It would have been strange,
indeed, if the discovery of photography had not
been followed by its application to astronomy.</p>

<p>The whole range of chemical science contains
no experiment of greater inherent interest than
the development of a photographic plate. Let
but the smallest ray of light fall upon its
strangely sensitive surface, and some subtle invisible
change takes place. It is then merely necessary
to plunge the plate into a properly prepared
chemical bath, and the gradual process of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
developing the picture begins. Slowly, very
slowly, the colorless surface darkens wherever
light has touched it. Let us imagine that the
exposure has been made with an ordinary lens
and camera, and that it is a landscape seeming to
grow beneath the experimenter's eyes. At first
only the most conspicuous objects make their
appearance. But gradually the process extends,
until finally every tiny detail is reproduced with
marvellous fidelity to the original. The photographic
plate, when developed in this way, is
called a "negative." For in Nature luminous
points, or sources of light, are bright, while the
developing negative turns dark wherever light
has acted. Thus the negative, while true to Nature,
reproduces everything in a reversed way;
bright things are dark, and shadows appear light.
For ordinary purposes, therefore, the negative has
to be replaced by a new photograph made by copying
it again photographically. In this way it is
again reversed, giving us a picture corresponding
correctly to the facts as seen. Such a copy from
a negative is what is ordinarily called a photograph;
technically, it is known as a "positive."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the remarkable things about the sensitive
plate is its complete indifference to the distance
from which the light comes. It is ready
to yield obediently to the ray of some distant
star that may have journeyed, as it were, from
the very vanishing point of space, or to the
bright glow of an electric light upon the photographer's
table. This quality makes its use especially
advantageous in astronomy, since we can
gain knowledge of remote stars only by a study
of the light they send us. In such study the
photographic plate possesses a supreme advantage
over the human eye. If the conditions of
weather and atmosphere are favorable, an observer
looking through an ordinary telescope
will see nearly as much at the first glance as he
will ever see. Attentive and continued study will
enable him to fix details upon his memory, and
to record them by means of drawings and diagrams.
Occasional moments of especially undisturbed
atmospheric conditions will allow him
to glimpse faint objects seldom visible. But on
the whole, telescopic astronomers add little to
their harvest by continued husbandry in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
same field of stars. Photography is different.
The effect of light upon the sensitive surface of
the plate is strictly cumulative. If a given star
can bring about a certain result when it has been
allowed to act upon the plate for one minute,
then in two or three minutes it will accomplish
much more. Perhaps a single minute's exposure
would have produced a mark scarcely perceptible
upon the developed negative. In that case,
three or four minutes would give us a perfectly
well defined black image of the star.</p>

<span class="fs80">Photographed by Barnard, February 1, 1894.<br />
Exposure, three hours.</span></div>
</div>

<p>Thus, by lengthening the exposure we can
make the fainter stars impress themselves upon
the plate. If their light is not able to produce
the desired effect in minutes, we can let its action
accumulate for hours. In this manner it becomes
possible and easy to photograph objects
so faint that they have never been seen, even
with our most powerful telescopes. This
achievement ranks high among those which
make astronomy appeal so strongly to the imagination.
Scientific men are not given to fancies;
nor should they be. But the first long-exposure
photograph must have been an exciting thing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>After coming from the observatory, the chemical
development was, of course, made in a dark
room, so that no additional light might harm the
plate until the process was complete. Carrying
it out then into the light, that early experimenter
cannot but have felt a thrill of triumph;
for his hand held a true picture of dim stars to
the eye unlighted, lifted into view as if by magic.</p>

<p>Plates have been thus exposed as long as
twenty-five hours, and the manner of doing it is
very interesting. Of course, it is impossible to
carry on the work continuously for so long a
period, since the beginning of daylight would
surely ruin the photograph. In fact, the astronomer
must stop before even the faintest streak of
dawn begins to redden the eastern sky. Moreover,
making astronomical negatives requires excessively
close attention, and this it is impossible
to give continuously during more than a few
hours. But the exposure of a single plate can be
extended over several nights without difficulty.
It is merely necessary to close the plate-holder
with a "light-tight" cover when the first night's
work is finished. To begin further exposure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the same plate on another night, we simply aim
the photographic telescope at precisely the same
point of the sky as before. The light-tight
plate-holder being again opened, the exposure
can go on as if there had been no interruption.</p>

<p>Astronomers have invented a most ingenious
device for making sure that the telescope's aim
can be brought back again to the same point with
great exactness. This is a very important matter;
for the slightest disturbance of the plate before
the second or subsequent portions of the exposure
would ruin everything. Instead of a very
complete single picture, we should have two partial
ones mixed up together in inextricable confusion.</p>

<p>To prevent this, photographic telescopes are
made double, not altogether unlike an opera-glass.
One of the tubes is arranged for photography
proper, while the other is fitted with lenses suitable
for an ordinary visual telescope. The two tubes
are made parallel. Thus the astronomer, by looking
through the visual glass, can watch objects in
the heavens even while they are being photographed.
The visual half of the instrument is
provided with a pair of very fine cross-wires mov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>able
at will in the field of view. These can be
made to bisect some little star exactly, before beginning
the first night's work. Afterward, everything
about the instrument having been left unchanged,
the astronomer can always assure himself
of coming back to precisely the same point of the
sky, by so adjusting the instrument that the same
little star is again bisected.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that the
entire instrument remains unmoved, even during
the whole of a single night's exposure. For in
that case, the apparent motion of the stars as they
rise or set in the sky would speedily carry them
out of the telescope's field of view. Consequently,
this motion has to be counteracted by shifting
the telescope so as to follow the stars. This
can be accomplished accurately and automatically
by means of clock-work mechanism. Such contrivances
have already been applied in the past to
visual telescopes, because even then they facilitated
the observer's work. They save him the
trouble of turning his instrument every few minutes,
and allow him to give his undivided attention
to the actual business of observation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>For photographic purposes the telescope needs
to "follow" the stars far more accurately than in
the older kind of observing with the eye. Nor is
it possible to make a clock that will drive the instrument
satisfactorily and quite automatically.
But by means of the second or visual telescope,
astronomers can always ascertain whether the
clock is working correctly at any given moment.
It requires only a glance at the little star bisected
by the cross-wires, and, if there has been the
slightest imperfection in the following by clock-work,
the star will no longer be cut exactly by
the wires.</p>

<p>The astronomer can at once correct any error
by putting in operation a very ingenious mechanical
device sometimes called a "mouse-control."
He need only touch an electric button,
and a signal is sent into the clock-work.
Instantly there is a shifting of the mechanism.
For one of the regular driving wheels is substituted,
temporarily, another having an <em>extra tooth</em>.
This makes the clock run a little faster so long
as the electric current passes. In a similar way,
by means of another button, the clock can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
made to run slower temporarily. Thus by
watching the cross-wires continuously, and manipulating
his two electric buttons, the photographic
astronomer can compel his telescope to
follow exactly the object under observation, and
he can make certain of obtaining a perfect negative.</p>

<p>These long-exposure plates are intended especially
for what may be called descriptive astronomy.
With them, as we have seen, advantage is
taken of cumulative light-effects on the sensitive
plate, and the telescope's light-gathering and
space-penetrating powers are vastly increased.
We are enabled to carry our researches far beyond
the confines of the old visible universe.
Extremely faint objects can be recorded, even
down to their minutest details, with a fidelity unknown
to older visual methods. But at present
we intend to consider principally applications
of photography in the astronomy of measurement,
rather than the descriptive branch of our
subject. Instead of describing pictures made
simply to see what certain objects look like in
the sky, we shall consider negatives intended for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
precise measurement, with all that the word precision
implies in celestial science.</p>

<p>Taking up first the photography of stars, we
must begin by mentioning the work of Rutherfurd
at New York. More than thirty years ago
he had so far perfected methods of stellar photography
that he was able to secure excellent
pictures of stars as faint as the ninth magnitude.
In those days the modern process of dry-plate
photography had not been invented. To-day,
plates exposed in the photographic telescope are
made of glass covered with a perfectly dry film
of sensitized gelatine. But in the old wet-plate
process the sensitive film was first wetted with a
chemical solution; and this solution could not be
allowed to dry during the exposure. Consequently,
Rutherfurd was limited to exposures a
few minutes in length, while nowadays, as we
have said, their duration can be prolonged at will.</p>

<p>When we add to this the fact that the old
plates were far less sensitive to light than those
now available, it is easy to see what were the difficulties
in the way of photographing faint stars
in Rutherfurd's time. Nor did he possess the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
modern ingenious device of a combined visual
and photographic instrument. He had no electric
controlling apparatus. In fact, the younger
generation of astronomers can form no adequate
idea of the patience and personal skill Rutherfurd
must have had at his command. For he
certainly did produce negatives that are but little
inferior to the best that can be made to-day.
His only limitation was that he could not
obtain images of stars much below the ninth
magnitude.</p>

<p>To understand just what is meant here by the
ninth magnitude, it is necessary to go back in imagination
to the time of Hipparchus, the father
of sidereal astronomy. (See <a href="#Page_39">page 39</a>.) He
adopted the convenient plan of dividing all the
stars visible to the naked eye (of course, he had
no telescope) into six classes, according to their
brilliancy. The faintest visible stars were put in
the sixth class, and all the others were assigned
somewhat arbitrarily to one or the other of the
brighter classes.</p>

<p>Modern astronomers have devised a more scientific
system, which has been made to conform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
very nearly to that of Hipparchus, just as it has
come down to us through the ages. We have
adopted a certain arbitrary degree of luminosity
as the standard "first-magnitude"; compared with
sunlight, this may be represented roughly by a
fraction of which the numerator is 1, and the denominator
about eighty thousand millions. The
standard second-magnitude star is one whose
light, compared with a first-magnitude, may be
represented approximately by the fraction ⅖.
The third magnitude, in turn, may be compared
with the second by the same fraction ⅖; and so
the classification is extended to magnitudes below
those visible to the unaided eye. Each magnitude
compares with the one above it, as the light
of two candles would compare with the light of
five.</p>

<p>Rutherfurd did not stop with mere photographs.
He realized very clearly the obvious
truth that by making a picture of the sky we
simply change the scene of our operations.
Upon the photograph we can measure that which
we might have studied directly in the heavens;
but so long as they remain unmeasured, celestial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
pictures have a potential value only. Locked
within them may lie hidden some secret of our
universe. But it will not come forth unsought.
Patient effort must precede discovery, in photography,
as elsewhere in science. There is no
royal road. Rutherfurd devised an elaborate
measuring-machine in which his photographs
could be examined under the microscope with
the most minute exactness. With this machine
he measured a large number of his pictures; and
it has been shown quite recently that the results
obtained from them are comparable in accuracy
with those coming from the most highly accredited
methods of direct eye-observation.</p>

<p>And photographs are far superior in ease of manipulation.
Convenient day-observing under the
microscope in a comfortable astronomical laboratory
is substituted for all the discomforts of a
midnight vigil under the stars. The work of
measurement can proceed in all weathers, whereas
formerly it was limited strictly to perfectly clear
nights. Lastly, the negatives form a permanent
record, to which we can always return to correct
errors or re-examine doubtful points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Rutherfurd's stellar work extended down to
about 1877, and included especially parallax determinations
and the photography of star-clusters.
Each of these subjects is receiving close attention
from later investigators, and, therefore, merits
brief mention here. Stellar parallax is in one
sense but another name for stellar distance. Its
measurement has been one of the important
problems of astronomy for centuries, ever since
men recognized that the Copernican theory of
our universe requires the determination of stellar
distances for its complete demonstration.</p>

<p>If the earth is swinging around the sun once a
year in a mighty path or orbit, there must be
changes of its position in space comparable in size
with the orbit itself. And the stars ought to shift
their apparent places on the sky to correspond
with these changes in the terrestrial observer's
position. The phenomenon is analogous to what
occurs when we look out of a room, first through
one window, and then through another. Any
object on the opposite side of the street will be
seen in a changed direction, on account of the
observer's having shifted his position from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
window to the other. If the object seemed to
be due north when seen from the first window,
it will, perhaps, appear a little east of north from
the other. But this change of direction will be
comparatively small, if the object under observation
is very far away, in comparison with the distance
between the two windows.</p>

<p>This is what occurs with the stars. The earth's
orbit, vast as it is, shrinks into almost absolute
insignificance when compared with the profound
distances by which we are sundered from even
the nearest fixed stars. Consequently, the shifting
of their positions is also very small&mdash;so
small as to be near the extreme limit separating
that which is measurable from that which is beyond
human ken.</p>

<p>Photography lends itself most readily to a
study of this matter. Suppose a certain star is
suspected of "having a parallax." In other
words, we have reason to believe it near enough
to admit of a successful measurement of distance.
Perhaps it is a very bright star; and, other
things being equal, it is probably fair to assume
that brightness signifies nearness. And astrono<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>mers
have certain other indications of proximity
that guide them in the selection of proper objects
for investigation, though such evidence, of course,
never takes the place of actual measurement.</p>

<p>The star under examination is sure to have near
it on the sky a number of stars so very small
that we may safely take them to be immeasurably
far away. The parallax star is among them,
but not of them. We see it projected upon the
background of the heavens, though it may in
reality be quite near us, astronomically speaking.
If this is really so, and the star, therefore, subject
to the slight parallactic shifting already mentioned,
we can detect it by noting the suspected
star's position among the surrounding small
stars. For these, being immeasurably remote,
will remain unchanged, within the limits of our
powers of observation, and thus serve as points
of reference for marking the apparent shifting of
the brighter star we are actually considering.</p>

<p>We have merely to photograph the region at
various seasons of the year. Careful examination
of the photographs under the microscope
will then enable us to measure the slightest dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>placement
of the parallax star. From these
measures, by a process of calculation, astronomers
can then obtain the star's distance. It will
not become known in miles; we shall only ascertain
how many times the distance between the
earth and sun would have to be laid down like a
measuring-rod, in order to cover the space separating
us from the star: and the subsequent
evaluation of this distance "earth to sun" in
miles is another important problem in whose solution
photography promises to be most useful.</p>

<p>The above method of measuring stellar distance
is, of course, subject to whatever slight uncertainty
arises from the assumption that the small stars
used for comparison are themselves beyond the
possibility of parallactic shifting. But astronomy
possesses no better method. Moreover,
the number of small stars used in this way is, of
course, much larger in photography than it ever
can be in visual work. In the former process,
all surrounding stars can be photographed at
once; in the latter each star must be measured
separately, and daylight soon intervenes to impose
a limit on numbers. Usually only two can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
be used; so that here photography has a most
important advantage. It minimizes the chance
of our parallax being rendered erroneous, by the
stars of comparison not being really infinitely
remote. This might happen, perhaps, in the
case of one or two; but with an average result
from a large number we know it to be practically
impossible.</p>

<p>Cluster work is not altogether unlike "parallax
hunting" in its preliminary stage of securing
the photographic observations. The object is to
obtain an absolutely faithful picture of a star
group, just as it exists in the sky. We have
every reason to suppose that a very large number
of stars condensed into one small spot upon
the heavens means something more than chance
aggregation. The Pleiades group (<a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>) contains
thousands of massive stars, doubtless held
together by the force of their mutual gravitational
attraction. If this be true, there must be
complex orbital motion in the cluster; and, as
time goes on, we should actually see the separate
components change their relative positions,
as it were, before our eyes. The details of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
motion upon the great scale of cosmic space offer
one of the many problems that make astronomy
the grandest of human sciences.</p>

<p>We have said that time must pass before we
can see these things; there may be centuries of
waiting. But one way exists to hurry on the
perfection of our knowledge; we must increase
the precision of observations. Motions that
would need the growth of centuries to become
visible to the older astronomical appliances,
might yield in a few decades to more delicate
observational processes. Here photography is
most promising. Having once obtained a surpassingly
accurate picture of a star-cluster, we
can subject it easily to precise microscopic measurement.
The same operations repeated at a
later date will enable us to compare the two
series of measures, and thus ascertain the motions
that may have occurred in the interval.
The Rutherfurd photographs furnish a veritable
mine of information in researches of this kind;
for they antedate all other celestial photographs
of precision by at least a quarter-century, and
bring just so much nearer the time when definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
knowledge shall replace information based on
reasoning from probabilities.</p>

<p>Rutherfurd's methods showed the advantages
of photography as applied to individual star-clusters.
It required only the attention of some
astronomer disposing of large observational facilities,
and accustomed to operations upon a great
scale, to apply similar methods throughout the
whole heavens. In the year 1882 a bright
comet was very conspicuous in the southern
heavens. It was extensively observed from the
southern hemisphere, and especially at the British
Royal Observatory at the Cape of Good Hope.</p>

<p>Gill, director of that institution, conceived the
idea that this comet might be bright enough
to photograph. At that time, comet photography
had been attempted but little, if at all, and it
was by no means sure that the experiment would
be successful. Nor was Gill well acquainted with
the work of Rutherfurd; for the best results of
that astronomer had lain dormant many years.
He was one of those men with whom personal
modesty amounts to a fault. Loath to put himself
forward in any way, and disliking to rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
into print, Rutherfurd had given but little publicity
to his work. This peculiarity has, doubtless,
delayed his just reputation; but he will lose
nothing in the end from a brief postponement.
Gill must, however, be credited with more penetration
than would be his due if Rutherfurd had
made it possible for others to know that he had
anticipated many of the newer ideas.</p>

<p>However this may be, the comet was photographed
with the help of a local portrait photographer
named Allis. When Gill and Allis fastened
a simple portrait camera belonging to the
latter upon the tube of one of the Cape telescopes,
and pointed it at the great comet, they
little thought the experiment would lead to one
of the greatest astronomical works ever attempted
by men. Yet this was destined to occur.
The negative they obtained showed an
excellent picture of the comet; but what was
more important for the future of sidereal astronomy,
it was also quite thickly dotted with little
black points corresponding to stars. The extraordinary
ease with which the whole heavens
could be thus charted photographically was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
brought home to Gill as never before. It was
this comet picture that interested him in the application
of photography to star-charting; and
without his interest the now famous astro-photographic
catalogue of the heavens would probably
never have been made.</p>

<p>After considerable preliminary correspondence,
a congress of astronomers was finally called to
meet at Paris in 1887. Representatives of the
principal observatories and civilized governments
were present. They decided that the end of the
nineteenth century should see the making of a
great catalogue of all the stars in the sky, upon a
scale of completeness and precision surpassing
anything previously attempted. It is impossible
to exaggerate the importance of such a work;
for upon our star-catalogues depends ultimately
the entire structure of astronomical science.</p>

<p>The work was far too vast for the powers of
any observatory alone. Therefore, the whole
sky, from pole to pole, was divided into eighteen
belts or zones of approximately equal area; and
each of these was assigned to a single observatory
to be photographed. A series of telescopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
was specially constructed, so that every part of
the work should be done with the same type of
instrument. As far as possible, an attempt was
made to secure uniformity of methods, and particularly
a uniform scale of precision. To cover
the entire sky upon the plan proposed no less
than 44,108 negatives are required; and most
of these have now been finished. The further
measurement of the pictures and the drawing up
of a vast printed star-catalogue are also well under
way. One of the participating observatories,
that at Potsdam, Germany, has published the first
volume of its part of the catalogue. It is estimated
that this observatory alone will require
twenty quarto volumes to contain merely the
final results of its work on the catalogue. Altogether
not less than two million stars will find a
place in this, our latest directory of the heavens.</p>

<p>Such wholesale methods of attacking problems
of observational astronomy are particularly characteristic
of photography. The great catalogue
is, perhaps, the best illustration of this tendency;
but of scarcely smaller interest, though less important
in reality, is the photographic method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
dealing with minor planets. We have already
said (<a href="#Page_63">page 63</a>) that in the space between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter several hundred small bodies
are moving around the sun in ordinary planetary
orbits. These bodies are called asteroids, or
minor planets. The visual method of discovering
unknown members of this group was painfully
tedious; but photography has changed
matters completely, and has added immensely
to our knowledge of the asteroids.</p>

<p>Wolf, of Heidelberg, first made use of the
new process for minor-planet discovery. His
method is sufficiently ingenious to deserve brief
mention again. A photograph of a suitable region
of the sky was made with an exposure lasting
two or three hours. Throughout all this
time the instrument was manipulated so as to
follow the motion of the heavens in the way we
have already explained, so that each star would
appear on the negative as a small, round, black
dot.</p>

<p>But if a minor planet happened to be in the
region covered by the plate, its photographic
image would be very different. For the orbital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
motion of the planet about the sun would make
it move a little among the stars even in the two
or three hours during which the plate was exposed.
This motion would be faithfully reproduced
in the picture, so that the planet would
appear as a short curved line rather than a well-defined
dot like a star. Thus the presence of
such a line-image infallibly denotes an asteroid.</p>

<p>Subsequent calculations are necessary to ascertain
whether the object is a planet already known
or a genuine new discovery. Wolf, and others
using his method in recent years, have made immense
additions to our catalogue of asteroids.
Indeed, the matter was beginning to lose interest
on account of the frequency and sameness
of these discoveries, when the astronomical world
was startled by the finding of the Planet of 1898.
(<a href="#Page_58">Page 58</a>.)</p>

<p>On August 27, 1898, Witt, of Berlin, discovered
the small body that bears the number
"433" in the list of minor planets, and has received
the name Eros. Its important peculiarity
consists in the exceptional position of the
orbit. While all the other asteroids are farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
from the sun than Mars, and less distant than
Jupiter, Eros can pass within the orbit of the
former. At times, therefore, it will approach
our earth more closely than any other permanent
member of the solar system, excepting our own
moon. So it is, in a sense, our nearest neighbor;
and this fact alone makes it the most interesting
of all the minor planets. The nineteenth
century was opened by Piazzi's well-known discovery
of the first of these bodies (<a href="#Page_59">page 59</a>); it
is, therefore, fitting that we should find the most
important one at its close. We are almost certain
that it will be possible to make use of Eros
to solve with unprecedented accuracy the most
important problem in all astronomy. This is the
determination of our earth's distance from the sun.
When considering stellar parallax, we have seen
how our observations enable us to measure some
of the stars' distances in terms of the distance
"earth to sun" as a unit. It is, indeed, the fundamental
unit for all astronomical measures, and
its exact evaluation has always been considered
the basal problem of astronomy. Astronomers
know it as the problem of Solar Parallax.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall not here enter into the somewhat
intricate details of this subject, however interesting
they may be. The problem offers difficulties
somewhat analogous to those confronting
a surveyor who has to determine the distance of
some inaccessible terrestrial point. To do this,
it is necessary first to measure a "base-line," as
we call it. Then the measurement of angles
with a theodolite will make it possible to deduce
the required distance of the inaccessible point by
a process of calculation. To insure accuracy,
however, as every surveyor knows, the base-line
must be made long enough; and this is precisely
what is impossible in the case of the solar
parallax.</p>

<p>For we are necessarily limited to marking
out our base-line on the earth; and the entire
planet is too small to furnish one of really sufficient
size. The best we can do is to use the distance
between two observatories situated, as near
as may be, on opposite sides of the earth. But
even this base is wofully small. However, the
smallness loses some of its harmful effect if we
operate upon a planet that is comparatively near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
us. We can measure such a planet's distance
more accurately than any other; and this being
known, the solar distance can be computed by
the aid of mathematical considerations based
upon Newton's law of gravitation and observational
determinations of the planetary orbital
elements.</p>

<p>Photography is by no means limited to investigations
in the older departments of astronomical
observation. Its powerful arm has been
stretched out to grasp as well the newer instruments
of spectroscopic study. Here the sensitive
plate has been substituted for the human
eye with even greater relative advantage. The
accurate microscopic measurement of difficult
lines in stellar spectra was indeed possible by
older methods; but photography has made it
comparatively easy; and, above all, has rendered
practicable series of observations extensive
enough in numbers to furnish statistical information
of real value. Only in this way have we
been able to determine whether the stars, in their
varied and unknown orbits, are approaching us
or moving farther away. Even the speed of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>approach or recession has become measurable,
and has been evaluated in the case of many individual
stars. (See <a href="#Page_21">page 21</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p>The subject of solar physics has become a veritable
department of astronomy in the hands of
photographic investigators. Ingenious spectro-photographic
methods have been devised, whereby
we have secured pictures of the sun from
which we have learned much that must have
remained forever unknown to older methods.</p>

<p>Especially useful has photography proved itself
in the observation of total solar eclipses. It is
only when the sun's bright disk is completely
obscured by the interposed moon that we can see
the faintly luminous structure of the solar corona,
that great appendage of our sun, whose
exact nature is still unexplained. Only during
the few minutes of total eclipse in each century
can we look upon it; and keen is the interest of
astronomers when those few minutes occur. But
it is found that eye observations made in hurried
excitement have comparatively little value.
Half a dozen persons might make drawings of
the corona during the same eclipse, yet they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
would differ so much from one another as to
leave the true outline very much in doubt. But
with photography we can obtain a really correct
picture whose details can be studied and discussed
subsequently at leisure.</p>

<p>If we were asked to sum up in one word what
photography has accomplished, we should say
that observational astronomy has been revolutionized.
There is to-day scarcely an instrument
of precision in which the sensitive plate
has not been substituted for the human eye;
scarcely an inquiry possible to the older method
which cannot now be undertaken upon a grander
scale. Novel investigations formerly not even
possible are now entirely practicable by photography;
and the end is not yet. Valuable as are
the achievements already consummated, photography
is richest in its promise for the future.
Astronomy has been called the "perfect science";
it is safe to predict that the next generation
will wonder that the knowledge we have
to-day should ever have received so proud a
title.</p>


<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="TIME_STANDARDS_OF_THE" id="TIME_STANDARDS_OF_THE">TIME STANDARDS OF THE
WORLD</a></h2>


<p>The question is often asked, "What is the
practical use of astronomy?" We know, of
course, that men would profit greatly from a study
of that science, even if it could not be turned to
any immediate bread-and-butter use; for astronomy
is essentially the science of big things, and it
makes men bigger to fix their minds on problems
that deal with vast distances and seemingly endless
periods of time. No one can look upon the
quietly shining stars without being impressed by
the thought of how they burned&mdash;then as now&mdash;before
he himself was born, and so shall continue
after he has passed away&mdash;aye, even after his latest
descendants shall have vanished from the
earth. Of all the sciences, astronomy is at once
the most beautiful poetically, and yet the one
offering the grandest and most difficult problems
to the intellect. A study of these problems has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
ever been a labor of love to the greatest minds;
their solution has been counted justly among
man's loftiest achievements.</p>

<p>And yet of all the difficult and abstruse sciences,
astronomy is, perhaps, the one that comes into the
ordinary practical daily life of the people more
definitely and frequently than any other. There
exist at least three things we owe to astronomy
that must be regarded as quite indispensable,
from a purely practical point of view. In the first
place, let us consider the maps in a work on geography.
How many people ever think to ask
how these maps are made? It is true that the
ordinary processes of the surveyor would enable
us to draw a map showing the outlines of a part of
the earth's surface. Even the locations of towns
and rivers might be marked in this way. But one
of the most important things of all could not be
added without the aid of astronomical observations.
The latitude and longitude lines, which are
essential to show the relation of the map to the
rest of the earth, we owe to astronomy. The longitude
lines, particularly, as we shall see farther on,
play a most important part in the subject of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The second indispensable application of astronomy
to ordinary business affairs relates to the
subject of navigation. How do ships find their
way across the ocean? There are no permanent
marks on the sea, as there are on the land, by
which the navigator can guide his course. Nevertheless,
seamen know their path over the trackless
ocean with a certainty as unerring as would
be possible on shore; and it is all done by the
help of astronomy. The navigator's observations
of the sun are astronomical observations;
the tables he uses in calculating his observations&mdash;the
tables that tell him just where he is and in what
direction he must go&mdash;are astronomical tables.
Indeed, it is not too much to say that without
astronomy there could be no safe ocean navigation.</p>

<p>But the third application of astronomy is of
still greater importance in our daily life&mdash;the furnishing
of correct time standards for all sorts of
purposes. It is to this practical use of astronomical
science that we would direct particular attention.
Few persons ever think of the complicated
machinery that must be put in motion in
order to set a clock. A man forgets some even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>ing
to wind his watch at the accustomed hour.
The next morning he finds it run down. It
must be re-set. Most people simply go to the
nearest clock, or ask some friend for the time, so
as to start the watch correctly. More careful persons,
perhaps, visit the jeweller's and take the
time from his "regulator." But the regulator
itself needs to be regulated. After all, it is nothing
more than any other clock, except that greater
care has been taken in the mechanical construction
and arrangement of its various parts. Yet it is
but a machine built by human hands, and, like
all human works, it is necessarily imperfect. No
matter how well it has been constructed, it will
not run with perfectly rigid accuracy. Every day
there will be a variation from the true time by a
small amount, and in the course of days or weeks
the accumulation of these successive small amounts
will lead to a total of quite appreciable size.</p>

<p>Just as the ordinary citizen looks to the jeweller's
regulator to correct his watch, so the jeweller
applies to the astronomer for the correction of his
regulator. Ever since the dawn of astronomy, in
the earliest ages of which we have any record, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
principal duty of the astronomer has been the furnishing
of accurate time to the people. We shall
not here enter into a detailed account, however interesting
it would be, of the gradual development
by which the very perfect system at present in
use has been reached; but shall content ourselves
with a description of the methods now employed
in nearly all the civilized countries of the world.</p>

<p>In the first place, every observatory is, of course,
provided with what is known as an astronomical
clock. This instrument, from the astronomer's
point of view, is something very different from
the ordinary popular idea. To the average person
an astronomical clock is a complicated and
elaborate affair, giving the date, day of the week,
phases of the moon, and other miscellaneous information.
But in reality the astronomer wants
none of these things. His one and only requirement
is that the clock shall keep as near uniform
time as may be possible to a machine constructed
by human hands. No expense is spared in making
the standard clock for an observatory. Real
artists in mechanical construction&mdash;men who have
attained a world-wide celebrity for delicate skill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
in fashioning the parts of a clock&mdash;such are the
astronomer's clock-makers.</p>

<p>To increase precision of motion in the train of
wheels, it is necessary that the mechanism be as
simple as possible. For this reason all complications
of date, etc., are left out. We have even
abandoned the usual convenient plan of having
the hour and minute hands mounted at the same
centre; for this kind of mounting makes necessary
a slightly more intricate form of wheelwork.
The astronomer's clock usually has the centres
of the second hand, minute hand, and hour hand
in a straight line, and equally distant from each
other. Each hand has its own dial; all drawn,
of course, upon the same clock-face.</p>

<p>Even after such a clock has been made as accurately
as possible, it will, nevertheless, not give
the very best performance unless it is taken care
of properly. It is necessary to mount it very
firmly indeed. It should not be fastened to an
ordinary wall, but a strong pier of masonry or
brick must be built for it on a very solid foundation.
Moreover, this pier is best placed underground
in a cellar, so that the temperature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
clock can be kept nearly uniform all the year
round; for we find that clocks do not run quite
the same in hot weather as they do in cold.
Makers have, indeed, tried to guard against this
effect of temperature, by ingenious mechanical
contrivances. But these are never quite perfect
in their action, and it is best not to test them too
severely by exposing the clock to sharp changes
of heat and cold.</p>

<p>Another thing affecting the going of fine
clocks, strange as it may seem, is the variation of
barometric pressure. There is a slight but noticeable
difference in their running when the
barometer is high and when it is low. To prevent
this, some of our best clocks have been enclosed
in air-tight cases, so that outside barometric
changes may not be felt in the least by the clock
itself.</p>

<p>But even after all this has been accomplished,
and the astronomer is in possession of a clock that
may be called a masterpiece of mechanical construction,
he is not any better off than was the
jeweller with his regulator. After all, even the
astronomical clock needs to be set, and its error<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
must be determined from time to time. A
final appeal must then be had to astronomical
observations. The clock must be set by the
stars and sun. For this purpose the astronomer
uses an instrument called a "transit." This is
simply a telescope of moderate size, possibly five
or six feet long, and firmly attached to an axis at
right angles to the tube of the telescope.</p>

<p>This axis is supported horizontally in such a
way that it points as nearly as may be exactly
east and west. The telescope itself being square
with the axis, always points in a north-and-south
direction. It is possible to rotate the telescope
about its axis so as to reach all parts of the sky
that are directly north or south of the observatory.
In the field of view of the telescope certain
very fine threads are mounted so as to form
a little cross. As the telescope is rotated this
cross traces out, as it were, a great circle on the
sky; and this great circle is called the astronomical
meridian.</p>

<p>Now we are in possession of certain star-tables,
computed from the combined observations of
astronomers in the last 150 years. These tables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
tell us the exact moment of time when any star
is on the meridian. To discover, therefore,
whether our clock is right on any given night, it
is merely necessary to watch a star with the telescope,
and note the exact instant by the clock
when it reaches the little cross in the field of
view. Knowing from the astronomical tables the
time when the star ought to have been on the
meridian, and having observed the clock time
when it is actually there, the difference is, of
course, the error of the clock. The result can
be checked by observations of other stars, and
the slight personal errors of observation can be
rendered harmless by taking the mean from several
stars. By an hour's work on a fine night it
is possible to fix the clock error quite easily
within the one-twentieth part of a second.</p>

<p>We have not space to enter into the interesting
details of the methods by which the astronomical
transit is accurately set in the right
position, and how any slight residual error in
its setting can be eliminated from our results by
certain processes of computation. It must suffice
to say that practically all time determinations in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the observatory depend substantially upon the
procedure outlined above.</p>

<p>The observatory clock having been once set
right by observations of the sky, its error can be
re-determined every few days quite easily. Thus
even the small irregularities of its nearly perfect
mechanism can be prevented from accumulating
until they might reach a harmful magnitude.
But we obtain in this way only a correct standard
of time within the observatory itself. How can
this be made available for the general public?
The problem is quite simple with the aid of the
electric telegraph. We shall give a brief account
of the methods now in use in New York City,
and these may be taken as essentially representative
of those employed elsewhere.</p>

<p>Every day, at noon precisely, an electric signal
is sent out by the United States Naval Observatory
in Washington. The signal is regulated by
the standard clock of the observatory, of course
taking account of star observations made on the
next preceding fine night. This signal is received
in the central New York office of the telegraph
company, where it is used to keep correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
a very fine clock, which may be called the time
standard of the telegraph company. This clock,
in turn, has automatic electric connections, by
means of which it is made to send out signals
over what are called "time wires" that go all
over the city. Jewellers, and others who desire
correct time, can arrange to have a small electric
sounder in their offices connected with the time
wires. Thus the ticks of the telegraph company's
standard clock are repeated automatically
in the jeweller's shop, and used for controlling
the exactness of his regulator. This, in brief, is
the method by which the astronomer's careful
determination of correct time is transferred and
distributed to the people at large.</p>

<p>Having thus outlined the manner of obtaining
and distributing correct time, we shall now consider
the question of time differences between different
places on the earth. This is a matter which many
persons find most perplexing, and yet it is essentially
quite simple in principle. Travellers, of course,
are well acquainted with the fact that their watches
often need to be reset when they arrive at their
destination. Yet few ever stop to ask the cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us consider for a moment our method of
measuring time. We go by the sun. If we leave
out of account some small irregularities of the sun's
motion that are of no consequence for our present
purpose, we may lay down this fundamental principle:
When the sun reaches its highest position
in the sky it is twelve o'clock or noon.</p>

<p>The sun, as everyone knows, rises each morning
in the east, slowly goes up higher and higher
in the sky, and at last begins to descend again
toward the west. But it is clear that as the sun
travels from east to west, it must pass over the
eastern one of any two cities sooner than the
western one. When it reaches its greatest height
over a western city it has, therefore, already passed
its greatest height over an eastern one. In other
words, when it is noon, or twelve o'clock, in the
western city, it is already after noon in the eastern
city. This is the simple and evident cause of
time differences in different parts of the country.
Of any two places the eastern one always has later
time than the western. When we consider the
matter in this way there is not the slightest difficulty
in understanding how time differences arise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
They will, of course, be greatest for places that
are very far apart in an east-and-west direction.
And this brings us again to the subject of longitude,
which, as we have already said, plays an
important part in all questions relating to time;
for longitude is used to measure the distance in
an east-and-west direction between different parts
of the earth.</p>

<p>If we consider the earth as a large ball we can
imagine a series of great circles drawn on its surface
and passing directly from the North Pole to the
South Pole. Such a circle could be drawn through
any point on the earth. If we imagine a pair of
them drawn through two cities, such as New York
and London, the longitude difference of these two
cities is defined as the angle at the North Pole between
the two great circles in question. The size
of this angle can be expressed in degrees. If we
then wish to know the difference in time between
New York and London in hours, we need only
divide their longitude difference in degrees by the
number 15. In this simple way we can get the
time difference of any two places. We merely
measure the longitude difference on a map, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
then divide by 15 to get the time difference.
These time differences can sometimes become
quite large. Indeed, for two places differing 180
degrees in longitude, the time difference will evidently
be no less than twelve hours.</p>

<p>Most civilized nations have agreed informally
to adopt some one city as the fundamental point
from which all longitudes are to be counted. Up
to the present we have considered only longitude
differences; but when we speak of the longitude
of a city we mean its longitude difference from
the place chosen by common consent as the origin
for measuring longitudes. The town almost
universally used for this purpose is Greenwich,
near London, England. Here is situated the
British Royal Observatory, one of the oldest and
most important institutions of its kind in the
world. The great longitude circle passing through
the centre of the astronomical transit at the Greenwich
observatory is the fundamental longitude
circle of the earth. The longitude of any other
town is then simply the angle at the pole between
the longitude circle through that town and the
fundamental Greenwich one here described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Longitudes are counted both eastward and
westward from Greenwich. Thus New York is
in 74 degrees west longitude, while Berlin is in
14 degrees east longitude. This has led to a
rather curious state of affairs in those parts of the
earth the longitudes of which are nearly 180
degrees east or west. There are a number of
islands in that part of the world, and if we imagine
for a moment one whose longitude is just 180 degrees,
we shall have the following remarkable result
as to its time difference from Greenwich.</p>

<p>We have seen that of any two places the eastern
always has the later time. Now, since our imaginary
island is exactly 180 degrees from Greenwich,
we can consider it as being either 180 degrees
east or 180 degrees west. But if we call it
180 degrees east, its time will be twelve hours
later than Greenwich, and if we call it 180 degrees
west, its time will be twelve hours earlier than
Greenwich. Evidently there will be a difference
of just twenty-four hours, or one whole day, between
these two possible ways of reckoning its
time. This circumstance has actually led to considerable
confusion in some of the islands of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Pacific Ocean. The navigators who discovered
the various islands naturally gave them the date
which they brought from Europe. And as some
of these navigators sailed eastward, around the
Cape of Good Hope, and others westward, around
Cape Horn, the dates they gave to the several
islands differed by just one day.</p>

<p>The state of affairs at the present time has
been adjusted by a sort of informal agreement.
An arbitrary line has been drawn on the map
near the 180th longitude circle, and it has been
decided that the islands on the east side of this
line shall count their longitudes west from Greenwich,
and those west of the line shall count longitude
east from Greenwich. Thus Samoa is
nearly 180 degrees west of Greenwich, while the
Fiji Islands are nearly 180 degrees east. Yet the
islands are very near each other, though the arbitrary
line passes between them. As a result,
when it is Sunday in Samoa it is Monday in the
Fiji Islands. The arbitrary line described here
is sometimes called the International Date-Line.</p>

<p>It does not pass very near the Philippine
Islands, which are situated in about 120 degrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
east longitude, and, therefore, use a time about
eight hours later than Greenwich. New York,
being about 74 degrees west of Greenwich, is
about five hours earlier in time. Consequently,
as we may remark in passing, Philippine time is
about thirteen hours later than New York time.
Thus, five o'clock, Sunday morning, May 1st,
in Manila, would correspond to four o'clock,
Saturday afternoon, April 30th, in New York.</p>

<p>There is another kind of time which we shall explain
briefly&mdash;the so-called "standard," or railroad
time, which came into general use in the United
States some few years ago, and has since been
generally adopted throughout the world. It requires
but a few moments' consideration to see
that the accidental situation of the different large
cities in any country will cause their local times
to differ by odd numbers of hours, minutes, and
seconds. Thus a great deal of inconvenience
has been caused in the past. For instance, a
train might leave New York at a certain hour by
New York time. It would then arrive in Buffalo
some hours later by New York time. But
it would leave Buffalo by Buffalo time, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
quite different. Thus there would be a sort of
jump in the time-table at Buffalo, and it would
be a jump of an odd number of minutes.</p>

<p>It would be different in different cities, and very
hard to remember. Indeed, as each railway usually
ran its trains by the time used in the principal
city along its line, it might happen that three
or four different railroad times would be used in
a single city where several roads met. This has
all been avoided by introducing the standard
time system. According to this the whole country
is divided into a series of time zones, fifteen
degrees wide, and so arranged that the middle
line of each zone falls at a point whose longitude
from Greenwich is 60, 75, 90, 105, or 120 degrees.
The times at these middle lines are,
therefore, earlier than Greenwich time by an
even number of hours. Thus, for instance, the
75-degree line is just five even hours earlier than
Greenwich time. All cities simply use the time
of the nearest one of these special lines.</p>

<p>This does not result in doing away with time
differences altogether&mdash;that would, of course, be
impossible in the nature of things&mdash;but for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
complicated odd differences in hours and minutes,
we have substituted the infinitely simpler series
of differences in even hours. The traveller from
Chicago to New York can reset his watch by
putting it just one hour later on his arrival&mdash;the
minute hand is kept unchanged, and no New
York timepiece need be consulted to set the
watch right on arriving. There can be no doubt
that this standard-time system must be considered
one of the most important contributions of
astronomical science to the convenience of man.</p>

<p>Its value has received the widest recognition,
and its use has now extended to almost all civilized
countries&mdash;France is the only nation of importance
still remaining outside the time-zone
system. In the following table we give the
standard time of the various parts of the earth as
compared with Greenwich, together with the date
of adopting the new time system. It will be
noticed that in certain cases even half-hours have
been employed to separate the time-zones, instead
of even hours as used in the United States.</p>

<h2><a name="MOTIONS_OF_THE_EARTHS_POLE" id="MOTIONS_OF_THE_EARTHS_POLE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">MOTIONS OF THE EARTH'S POLE</a></h2>


<p>Students of geology have been puzzled for
many years by traces remaining from the period
when a large part of the earth was covered with a
heavy cap of ice. These shreds of evidence all
seem to point to the conclusion that the centre of
the ice-covered region was quite far away from
the present position of the north pole of the earth.
If we are to regard the pole as very near the
point of greatest cold, it becomes a matter of
much interest to examine whether the pole has
always occupied its present position, or whether
it has been subject to slow changes of place upon
the earth's surface. Therefore, the geologists
have appealed to astronomers to discover whether
they are in possession of any observational evidence
tending to show that the pole is in motion.</p>

<p>Now we may say at once that astronomical research
has not as yet revealed the evidence thus
expected. Astronomy has been unable to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to the rescue of geological theory. From about
the year 1750, which saw the beginning of precise
observation in the modern sense, down to very
recent times, astronomers were compelled to deny
the possibility of any appreciable motion of the
pole. Observational processes, it is true, furnished
slightly divergent pole positions from time
to time. Yet these discrepancies were always so
minute as to be indistinguishable from those slight
personal errors that are ever inseparable from results
obtained by the fallible human eye.</p>

<p>But in the last few years improved methods of
observation, coupled with extreme diligence in
their application by astronomers generally, have
brought to light a certain small motion of the
pole which had never before been demonstrated
in a reliable way. This motion, it is true, is not
of the character demanded by geological theory,
for the geologists had been led to expect a motion
which would be continuous in the same direction,
no matter how slow might be its annual amount;
for the vast extent of geologic time would give
even the slowest of motions an opportunity to
produce large effects, provided its results could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
be continuously cumulative. Given time enough,
and the pole might move anywhere on the earth,
no matter how slow might be its tortoise speed.</p>

<p>But the small motion we have discovered is
neither cumulative nor continuous in one direction.
It is what we call a periodic motion, the
pole swinging now to one side, and now to the
other, of its mean or average position. Thus
this new discovery cannot be said to unravel the
mysterious puzzle of the geologists. Yet it is
not without the keenest interest, even from their
point of view; for the proof of any form of
motion in a pole previously supposed to be absolutely
at rest may mean everything. No man
can say what results will be revealed by the further
observations now being continued with great
diligence.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is important to explain that
any such motions as we have under consideration
will show themselves to ordinary observational
processes principally in the form of changes
of terrestrial latitudes. Let us imagine a pair of
straight lines passing through the centre of the
earth and terminating, one at the observer's sta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>tion
on the earth's surface, and the other at that
point of the equator which is nearest the observer.
Then, according to the ordinary definition of latitude,
the angle between these two imaginary lines
is called the latitude of the point of observation.
Now we know, of course, that the equator is
everywhere just 90 degrees from the pole. Consequently,
if the pole is subject to any motion at
all, the equator must also partake of the motion.</p>

<p>Thus the angle between our two imaginary lines
will be affected directly by polar movement, and
the latitude obtained by astronomical observation
will be subject to quite similar changes. To clear
up the whole question, so far as this can be done
by the gathering of observational evidence, it is
only necessary to keep up a continual series of
latitude determinations at several observatories.
These determinations should show small variations
similar in magnitude to the wabblings of the
pole.</p>

<p>Let us now consider for a moment what is
meant by the axis of the earth. It has long been
known that the planet has in general the shape of
a ball or sphere. That this is so can be seen at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
once from the way ships at sea disappear at the
horizon. As they go farther and farther from us,
we first lose sight of the hull, and then slowly
and gradually the spars and sails seem to sink
down into the ocean. This proves that the
earth's surface is curved. That it is more or less
like a sphere is evident from the fact that it always
casts a round shadow in eclipses. Sometimes the
earth passes between the sun and eclipsed moon.
Then we see the earth's black shadow projected
on the moon, which would otherwise be quite
bright. This shadow has been observed in a very
large number of such eclipses, and it has always
been found to have a circular edge.</p>

<p>While, therefore, the earth is nearly a round
ball, it must not be supposed that it is exactly
spherical in form. We may disregard the small
irregularities of its surface, for even the greatest
mountains are insignificant in height when compared
with the entire diameter of the earth itself.
But even leaving these out of account, the earth is
not perfectly spherical. We can describe it best
as a flattened sphere. It is as though one were
to press a round rubber ball between two smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
boards. It would be flattened at the top and
bottom and bulged out in the middle. This is
the shape of the earth. It is flattened at the
poles and bulges out near the equator. The
shortest straight line that can be drawn through
the earth's centre and terminated by the flattened
parts of its surface may be called the earth's axis
of figure; and the two points where this axis
meets the surface are called the poles of figure.</p>

<p>But the earth has another axis, called the axis
of rotation. This is the one about which the
planet turns once in a day, giving rise to the well-known
phenomena called the rising and setting of
sun, moon, and stars. For these motions of the
heavenly bodies are really only apparent ones,
caused by an actual motion of the observer on
the earth. The observer turns with the earth on
its axis, and is thus carried past the sun and stars.</p>

<p>This daily turning of the earth, then, takes
place about the axis of rotation. Now, it so happens
that all kinds of astronomical observations
for the determination of latitude lead to values
based on the rotation axis of the earth, and not
on its axis of figure. We have seen how the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
earth's equator, from which we count our latitudes,
is everywhere 90 degrees distant from the
pole. But this pole is the pole of rotation, or
the point at which the rotation axis pierces the
earth's surface. It is not the pole of figure.</p>

<p>It is clear that the latitude of any observatory
will remain constant only if the pole of
figure and the rotation pole maintain absolutely
the same positions relatively one to the other.
These two poles are actually very near together;
indeed, it was supposed for a very long time that
they were absolutely coincident, so that there could
not be any variations of latitude. But it now
appears that they are separated slightly.</p>

<p>Strange to say, one of them is revolving
about the other in a little curve. The pole of
figure is travelling around the pole of rotation.
The distance between them varies a little, never
becoming greater than about fifty feet, and it
takes about fourteen months to complete a revolution.
There are some slight irregularities in
the motion, but, in the main, it takes place in the
manner here stated. In consequence of this rotation
of the one pole about the other, the pole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of figure is now on one side of the rotation pole
and now on the opposite side, but it never travels
continuously in one direction. Thus, as we have
already seen, the sort of continuous motion required
to explain the observed geological phenomena
has not yet been found by astronomers.</p>

<p>Observations for the study of latitude variations
have been made very extensively within
recent years both in Europe and the United
States. It has been found practically most advantageous
to carry out simultaneous series of
observations at two observatories situated in
widely different parts of the earth, but having
very nearly the same latitude. It is then possible
to employ the same stars for observation in
both places, whereas it would be necessary to
use different sets of stars if there were much
difference in the latitudes.</p>

<p>There is a special advantage in using the same
stars in both places. We can then determine
the small difference in latitude between the two
participating observatories in a manner which will
make it quite free from any uncertainty in our
knowledge of the positions on the sky of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
stars observed; for, strange as it may seem, our
star-catalogues do not contain absolutely accurate
numbers. Like all other data depending on
fallible human observation, they are affected with
small errors. But if we can determine simply
the difference in latitude of the two observatories,
we can discover from its variation the path in
which the pole is moving. If, for instance, the
observatories are separated by one-quarter the
circumference of the globe, the pole will be moving
directly toward one of them, when it is not
changing its distance from the other one at all.</p>

<p>This method was used for seven years with good
effect at the observatories of Columbia University
in New York, and the Royal Observatory at
Naples, Italy. For obtaining its most complete
advantages it is, of course, better to establish several
observing stations on about the same parallel
of latitude. This was done in 1899 by the International
Geodetic Association. Two stations are in
the United States, one in Japan, and one in Sicily.
We can, therefore, hope confidently that our knowledge
as to the puzzling problem of polar motion
will soon receive very material advancement.</p>

<h2><a name="SATURNS_RINGS" id="SATURNS_RINGS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">SATURN'S RINGS</a></h2>


<p>The death of James E. Keeler, Director of the
Lick Observatory, in California (<a href="#Page_32">p. 32</a>), recalls
to mind one of the most interesting and significant
of later advances in astronomical science.
Only seven years have elapsed since Keeler made
the remarkable spectroscopic observations which
gave for the first time an ocular demonstration of
the true character of those mysterious luminous
rings surrounding the brilliant planet Saturn.
His results have not yet been made sufficiently
accessible to the public at large, nor have they
been generally valued at their true worth. We
consider this work of Keeler's interesting, because
the problem of the rings has been a classic
one for many generations; and we have been
particular, also, to call it significant, because it is
pregnant with the possibilities of newer methods
of spectroscopic research, applied in the older
departments of observational astronomy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>The troubles of astronomers with the rings
began with the invention of the telescope itself.
They date back to 1610, when Galileo first
turned his new instrument to the heavens (<a href="#Page_49">p. 49</a>).
It may be imagined easily that the bright planet
Saturn was among the very first objects scrutinized
by him. His "powerful" instrument
magnified only about thirty times, and was,
doubtless, much inferior to our pocket telescopes
of to-day. But it showed, at all events, that
something was wrong with Saturn. Galileo put
it, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ultimam planet am tergeminam observavi</i>"
("I have observed the furthest planet to be
triple").</p>

<p>It is easy to understand now how Galileo's
eyes deceived him. For a round luminous ball
like Saturn, surrounded by a thin flat ring seen
nearly edgewise, really looks as if it had two little
attached appendages. Strange, indeed, it is
to-day to read a scientific book so old that the
planet Saturn could be called the "furthest"
planet. But it was the outermost known in
Galileo's day, and for nearly two centuries afterward.
Not until 1781 did William Herschel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
discover Uranus (<a href="#Page_59">p. 59</a>); and Neptune was not
disclosed by the marvellous mathematical perception
of Le Verrier until 1846 (<a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>).</p>

<p>Galileo's further observations of Saturn bothered
him more and more. The planet's behavior
became much worse as time went on. "Has
Saturn devoured his children, according to the
old legend?" he inquired soon afterward; for
the changed positions of earth and planet in the
course of their motions around the sun in their
respective orbits had become such that the ring
was seen quite edgewise, and was, therefore, perfectly
invisible to Galileo's "optic tube." The
puzzle remained unsolved by Galileo; it was left
for another great man to find the true answer.
Huygens, in 1656, first announced that the ring
<em>is</em> a ring.</p>

<p>The manner in which this announcement was
made is characteristic of the time; to-day it
seems almost ludicrous. Huygens published a
little pamphlet in 1656 called "<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Saturni Luna
Observatio Nova</cite>" or, "A New Observation of
Saturn's Moon." He gave the explanation of
what had been observed by himself and preced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>ing
astronomers in the form of a puzzle, or
"logogriph." Here is what he had to say of
the phenomenon in question:</p>

<p>"aaaaaaa ccccc d eeeee g h iiiiiii llll mm
nnnnnnnnn oooo pp q rr s ttttt uuuuu."</p>

<p>It was not until 1659, three years later, in a
book entitled "<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Systema Saturnium</cite>," that Huygens
rearranged the above letters in their proper
order, giving the Latin sentence:</p>

<p>"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Annulo cingitur, tenui plano, nusquam cohaerente,
ad eclipticam inclinato.</i>" Translated
into English, this sentence informs us that the
planet "is girdled with a thin, flat ring, nowhere
touching Saturn, and inclined to the ecliptic"!</p>

<p>This was a perfectly correct and wonderfully
sagacious explanation of those complex and exasperatingly
puzzling phenomena that had been
too difficult for no less a person than Galileo
himself. It was an explanation that <em>explained</em>.
The reason for its preliminary announcement in
the above manner must have been the following:
Huygens was probably not quite sure of his
ground in 1656, while three years afterward he
had become quite certain. By the publication of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the logogriph of 1656 he secured for himself the
credit of what he had done. If any other astronomer
had published the true explanation
after 1656, Huygens could have proved his
claim to priority by rearranging the letters of his
puzzle. On the other hand, if further researches
showed him that he was wrong, he would never
have made known the true meaning of his logogriph,
and would thus have escaped the ignominy
of making an erroneous explanation. Thus,
the method of announcement was comparable
in ingenuity with the Huygenian explanation
itself.</p>

<p>We are compelled to pass over briefly the entertaining
history of subsequent observations of
the ring, in order to explain the new work of
Keeler and others. Cassini, about 1675,
been able to show that the ring was double; that
there are really two independent rings, with a
distinct dark space between them. It was a case
of wheels within wheels. To our own eminent
countryman, W. C. Bond, of Cambridge, Mass.,
we owe the further discovery (Harvard College
Observatory, November, 1850) of the third<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
ring. This is also concentric with the other two,
and interior to them, but difficult to observe,
because of its much smaller luminosity.</p>

<p>It is almost transparent, and the brilliant light
of the planet's central ball is capable of shining
directly through it. For this reason the inner
ring is called the "gauze" or "crape" ring. If
we add to the above details the fact that our
modern large telescopes show slight irregularities
in the surface of the rings, especially when seen
edgewise, we have a brief statement of all that
the telescope has been able to reveal to us since
Galileo's time.</p>

<p>But of far greater interest than the mere fact
of their existence is the important cosmic question
as to the constitution, structure, and, above
all, durability of the ring system. Astronomers
often use the term "stability" with regard to
celestial systems like the ring system of Saturn.
By this they mean permanent durability. A
system is stable if its various parts can continue
in their present relationship to one another, without
violating any of the known laws of astronomy.
Whenever we study any collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
celestial objects, and endeavor to explain their
motions and peculiarities, we always seek some
explanation not inconsistent with the continued
existence of the phenomena in question. For
this there is, perhaps, no sufficient philosophical
basis. Probably much of the great celestial procession
is but a passing show, to be but for a
moment in the endless vista of cosmic time.</p>

<p>However this may be, we are bound to assume
as a working theory that Saturn has always
had these rings, and will always have them; and
it is for us to find out how this is possible. The
problem has been attacked mathematically by
various astronomers, including Laplace; but no
conclusive mathematical treatment was obtained
until 1857, when <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'James Clark-Maxwell'">James Clerk Maxwell</ins> proved
in a masterly manner that the rings could be
neither solid nor liquid. He showed, indeed,
that they would not last if they were continuous
bodies like the planets. A big solid wheel
would inevitably be torn asunder by any slight
disturbance, and then precipitated upon the planet's
surface. Therefore, the rings must be composed
of an immense number of small detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
particles, revolving around Saturn in separate
orbits, like so many tiny satellites.</p>

<p>This mathematical theory of the ring system
being once established, astronomers were more
eager than ever to obtain a visual confirmation
of it. We had, indeed, a sort of analogy in
the assemblage of so-called "minor planets"
(<a href="#Page_64">p. 64</a>), which are known to be revolving around
our sun in orbits situated between Mars and
Jupiter. Some hundreds of these are known
to exist, and probably there are countless others
too small for us to see. Such a swarm of tiny
particles of luminous matter would certainly
give the impression of a continuous solid body,
if seen from a distance comparable to that separating
us from Saturn. But arguments founded
on analogy are of comparatively little value.</p>

<p>Astronomers need direct and conclusive telescopic
evidence, and this was lacking until Keeler
made his remarkable spectroscopic observation in
1895. The spectroscope is a peculiar instrument,
different in principle from any other used
in astronomy; we study distant objects with it
by analyzing the light they send us, rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
by examining and measuring the details of their
visible surfaces. The reader will recall that according
to the modern undulatory theory, light
consists simply of a series of waves. Now, the
nature of waves is very far from being understood
in the popular mind. Most people, for
instance, think that the waves of ocean consist of
great masses of water rolling along the surface.</p>

<p>This notion doubtless arises from the behavior
of waves when they break upon the shore, forming
what we call surf. When a wave meets
with an immovable body like a sand beach, the
wave is broken, and the water really does roll
upon the beach. But this is an exceptional case.
Farther away from the shore, where the waves
are unimpeded, they consist simply of particles
of water moving straight up and down. None
of the water is carried by mere wave-action away
from the point over which it was situated at first.</p>

<p>Tides or other causes may move the water, but
not simple wave-motion alone. That this is so
can be proved easily. If a chip of wood be
thrown overboard from a ship at sea it will be
seen to rise and fall a long time on the waves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
but it will not move. Similarly, wind-waves are
often quite conspicuous on a field of grain; but
they are caused by the individual grain particles
moving up and down. The grain certainly cannot
travel over the ground, since each particle is
fast to its own stalk.</p>

<p>But while the particles do not travel, the wave-disturbance
does. At times it is transmitted to
a considerable distance from the point where it
was first set in motion. Thus, when a stone is
dropped into still water, the disturbance (though
not the water) travels in ever-widening circles,
until at last it becomes too feeble for us to perceive.
Light is just such a travelling wave-disturbance.
Beginning, perhaps, in some distant
star, it travels through space, and finally the
wave impinges on our eyes like the ocean-wave
breaking on a sand beach. Such a light-wave
affects the eye in some mysterious way. We
call it "seeing."</p>

<p>The spectroscope (<a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a>) enables us to measure
and count the waves reaching us each second
from any source of light. No matter how far
away the origin of stellar light may be, the spec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>troscope
examines the character of that light, and
tells us the number of waves set up every second.
It is this characteristic of the instrument
that has enabled us to make some of the most
remarkable observations of modern times. If
the distant star is approaching us in space, more
light-waves per second will reach us than we
should receive from the same star at rest. Thus
if we find from the spectroscope that there are
too many waves, we know that the star is coming
nearer; and if there are too few, we can
conclude with equal certainty that the star is
receding.</p>

<p>Keeler was able to apply the spectroscope in
this way to the planet Saturn and to the ring
system. The observations required dexterity
and observational manipulative skill in a superlative
degree. These Keeler had; and this work
of his will always rank as a classic observation.
He found by examining the light-waves from
opposite sides of the planet that the luminous
ball rotated; for one side was approaching us
and the other receding. This observation was,
of course, in accord with the known fact of Sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>urn's
rotation on his axis. With regard to the
rings, Keeler showed in the same way the existence
of an axial rotation, which appears not
to have been satisfactorily proved before, strange
as it may seem. But the crucial point established
by his spectroscope was that the interior
part of the rings rotates <em>faster</em> than the exterior.</p>

<p>The velocity of rotation diminishes gradually
from the inside to the outside. This fact is absolutely
inconsistent with the motion of a solid
ring; but it fits in admirably with the theory of
a ring comprised of a vast assemblage of small
separate particles. Thus, for the first time, astronomy
comes into possession of an observational
determination of the nature of Saturn's
rings, and Galileo's puzzle is forever solved.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HELIOMETER" id="THE_HELIOMETER"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE HELIOMETER</a></h2>


<p>Astronomical discoveries are always received
by the public with keen interest. Every new
fact read in the great open book of nature is written
eagerly into the books of men. For there
exists a strong curiosity to ascertain just how the
greater world is built and governed; and it must
be admitted that astronomers have been able to
satisfy that curiosity with no small measure of
success. But it is seldom that we hear of the
means by which the latest and most refined
astronomical observations are effected. Popular
imagination pictures the astronomer, as he doubtless
once was, an aged gentleman, usually having
a long white beard, and spending entire nights
staring at the sky through a telescope.</p>

<p>But the facts to-day are very different. The
working astronomer is an active man in the
prime of life, often a young man. He wastes no
time in star-gazing. His observations consist of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
exact measurements made in a precise, systematic,
and almost business-like manner. A night's
"watch" at the telescope is seldom allowed to
exceed about three hours, since it is found that
more continued exertions fatigue the eye and lead
to less accurate results. To this, of course, there
have been many notable exceptions, for endurance
of sight, like any form of physical strength, differs
greatly in different individuals. Astronomical research
does not include "picking out" the constellations,
and learning the Arabic names of individual
stars. These things are not without
interest; but they belong to astronomy's ancient
history, and are of little value except to afford
amusement and instruction to successive generations
of amateurs.</p>

<p>Among the instruments for carefully planned
measurements of precision the heliometer probably
takes first rank. It is at once the most
exquisitely accurate in its results, and the most
fatiguing to the observer, of all the varied apparatus
employed by the astronomer. The principle
upon which its construction depends is very
peculiar, and applies to all telescopes, even or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>dinary
ones for terrestrial purposes. If part of a
telescope lens be covered up with the hand, it
will still be possible to see through the instrument.
The glass lens at the end of the tube
farthest from the observer's eye helps to magnify
distant objects and make them seem nearer by
gathering to a single point, or focus, a greater
amount of their light than could be brought
together by the far smaller lens in the unaided
eye.</p>

<p>The telescope might very properly be likened
to an enlarged eye, which can see more than we
can, simply because it is bigger. If a telescope
lens has a surface one hundred times as large as
that of the lens in our eye, it will gather and bring
to a focus one hundred times as much light from a
distant object. Now, if any part of this telescope
be covered, the remaining part will, nevertheless,
gather and focus light just as though the whole
lens were in action; only, there will be less light
collected at the focus within the tube. The
small lens at the telescope's eye-end is simply a
magnifier to help our eye examine the image of
any distant object formed at the focus by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
large lens at the farther end of the instrument.
For of this simple character is the operation of
any telescope: the large glass lens at one end
collects a distant planet's light, and brings it to a
focus near the other end of the tube, where it
forms a tiny picture of the planet, which, in
turn, is examined with the little magnifier at
the eye-end.</p>

<p>Having arrived at the fundamental principle
that part of a lens will act in a manner similar to
a whole one, it is easy to explain the construction
of a heliometer. An ordinary telescope lens is
sawed in half by means of a thin round metal
disk revolved rapidly by machinery, and fed continually
with emery and water at its edge. The
cutting effect of emery is sufficient to make such
a disk enter glass much as an ordinary saw penetrates
wood. The two "semi-lenses," as they
are called, are then mounted separately in metal
holders. These are attached to one end of the
heliometer, called the "head," in such a way that
the two semi-lenses can slide side by side upon
metal guides. This head is then fastened to one
end of a telescope tube mounted in the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
way. The "head" end of the instrument is
turned toward the sky in observing, and at the
eye-end is placed the usual little magnifier we
have already described.</p>

<p>The observer at the eye-end has control of
certain rods by means of which he can push the
semi-lenses on their slides in the head at the
other end of the tube. Now, if he moves the
semi-lenses so as to bring them side by side exactly,
the whole arrangement will act like an ordinary
telescope. For the semi-lenses will then
fit together just as if the original glass had never
been cut. But if the half-lenses are separated a
little on their slides, each will act by itself. Being
slightly separated, each will cover a different
part of the sky. The whole affair acts as if the
observer at the eye-end were looking through
two telescopes at once. For each semi-lens acts
independently, just as if it were a complete glass
of only half the size.</p>

<p>Now, suppose there were a couple of stars in
the sky, one in the part covered by the first
semi-lens, and one in the part covered by the
second. The observer would, of course, see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
both stars at once upon looking into the little
magnifier at the eye-end of the heliometer.</p>

<p>We must remember that these stars will
appear in the field of view simply as two tiny
points of light. The astronomer, as we have
said, is provided with a simple system of long
rods, by means of which he can manipulate the
semi-lenses while the observation is being made.
If he slides them very slowly one way or the
other, the two star-points in the field of view will
be seen to approach each other. In this way
they can at last be brought so near together that
they will form but a single dot of light. Observation
with the heliometer consists in thus bringing
two star-images together, until at last they
are superimposed one upon the other, and we see
one image only. Means are provided by which
it is then possible to measure the amount of
separation of the two half-lenses. Evidently the
farther asunder on the sky are the two stars
under observation, the greater will be the separation
of the semi-lenses necessary to make a single
image of their light. Thus, measurement of the
lenses' separation becomes a means of determin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>ing
the separation of the stars themselves upon
the sky.</p>

<p>The two slides in the heliometer head are supplied
with a pair of very delicate measures or
"scales" usually made of silver. These can be
examined from the eye-end of the instrument by
looking through a long microscope provided for
this special purpose. Thus an extremely precise
value is obtained both of the separation of the
sliders and of the distance on the sky between
the stars under examination. Measures made in
this way with the heliometer are counted the
most precise of astronomical observations.</p>

<p>Having thus described briefly the kind of observations
obtained with the heliometer, we shall
now touch upon their further utilization. We
shall take as an example but one of their many
uses&mdash;that one which astronomers consider the
most important&mdash;the measurement of stellar distances.
(See also <a href="#Page_94">p. 94.</a>)</p>

<p>Even the nearest fixed star is almost inconceivably
remote from us. And astronomers
are imprisoned on this little earth; we cannot
bridge the profound distance separating us from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
the stars, so as to use direct measurement with
tape-line or surveyor's chain. We are forced to
have recourse to some indirect method. Suppose
a certain star is suspected, on account of its brightness,
or for some other reason, of being near us
in space, and so giving a favorable opportunity
for a determination of distance. A couple of
very faint stars are selected close by. These, on
account of their faintness, the astronomer may
regard as quite immeasurably far away. He then
determines with his heliometer the exact position
on the sky of the bright star with respect to the
pair of faint ones. Half a year is then allowed
to pass. During that time the earth has been
swinging along in its annual path or orbit around
the sun. Half a year will have sufficed to carry
the observer on the earth to the other side of
that path, and he is then 185,000,000 miles away
from his position at the first observation.</p>

<p>Another determination is made of the bright
star's position as referred to the two faint ones.
Now, if all these stars were equally distant, their
relative positions at the second observation would
be just the same as at the former one. But if, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
is very probable, the bright star is very much
nearer us than are the two faint ones, we shall
obtain a different position from our second observation.
For the change of 185,000,000 miles
in the observer's location will, of course, affect
the direction in which we see the near star, while
it will leave the distant ones practically unchanged.
Without entering into technical details, we may
say that from a large number of observations of
this kind, we can obtain the distance of the bright
star by a process of calculation. The only essential
is to have an instrument that can make
the actual observations of position accurately
enough; and in this respect the heliometer is still
unexcelled.</p>

<h2><a name="OCCULTATIONS" id="OCCULTATIONS"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">OCCULTATIONS</a></h2>


<p>Scarcely anyone can have watched the sky
without noticing how different is the behavior of
our moon from that of any other object we can
see. Of course, it has this in common with the
sun and stars and planets, that it rises in the
eastern horizon, slowly climbs the dome of the
sky, and again goes down and sets in the west.
This motion of the heavenly bodies is known to
be an apparent one merely, and caused by the
turning of our own earth upon its axis. A man
standing upon the earth's surface can look up
and see above him one-half the great celestial
vault, gemmed with twinkling stars, and bearing,
perhaps, within its ample curve one or two serenely
shining planets and the lustrous moon.
But at any given moment the observer can see
nothing of the other half of the heavenly sphere.
It is beneath his feet, and concealed by the solid
bulk of the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The earth, however, is turning on an axis,
carrying the observer with it. And so it is continually
presenting him to a new part of the sky.
At any moment he sees but a single half-sphere;
yet the very next instant it is no longer the same;
a small portion has passed out of sight on one
side by going down behind the turning earth,
while a corresponding new section has come into
view on the opposite side. It is this coming into
view that we call the rising of a star; and the
corresponding disappearance on the other side is
called setting. Thus rising and setting are, of
course, due entirely to a turning of the earth, and
not at all to actual motions of the stars; and for
this reason, all objects in the sky, without exception,
must rise and set again. But the moon
really has a motion of its own in addition to this
apparent one caused by the earth's rotation.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the dawn of time early watchers
of the stars thought out those fancied constellations
that survive even down to our own day.
They placed the mighty lion, king of beasts,
upon the face of night, and the great hunter, too,
armed with club and dagger, to pursue him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Among these constellations the moon threads her
destined way, night after night, so rapidly that
the unaided eye can see that she is moving. It
needs but little power of fancy's magic to recall
from the dim past a picture of some aged astronomer
graving upon his tablets the Records of
the Moon. "To-night she is near the bright
star in the eye of the Bull." And again: "To-night
she rides full, and near to the heart of the
Virgin."</p>

<p>And why does the moon ride thus through the
stars of night? Modern science has succeeded
in disentangling the intricacies of her motion,
until to-day only one or two of the very minutest
details of that motion remain unexplained. But
it has been a hard problem. Someone has well
said that lunar theory should be likened to a
lofty cliff upon whose side the intellectual giants
among men can mark off their mental stature,
but whose height no one of them may ever hope
to scale.</p>

<p>But for our present purpose it is unnecessary
to pursue the subject of lunar motion into its
abstruser details. To understand why the moon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
moves rapidly among the stars, it is sufficient to
remember that she is whirling quickly round the
earth, so as to complete her circuit in a little less
than a month. We see her at all times projected
upon the distant background of the sky on which
are set the stellar points of light, as though intended
for beacons to mark the course pursued
by moon and planets. The stars themselves have
no such motions as the moon; situated at a distance
almost inconceivably great, they may, indeed,
be travellers through empty space, yet their
journeys shrink into insignificance as seen from
distant earth. It requires the most delicate instruments
of the astronomer to so magnify the
tiny displacements of the stars on the celestial
vault that they may be measured by human eyes.</p>

<p>Let us again recur to our supposed observer
watching the moon night after night, so as to
record the stars closely approached by her. Why
should he not some time or other be surprised
by an approach so close as to amount apparently
to actual contact? The moon covers quite
a large surface on the sky, and when we remember
the nearly countless numbers of the stars, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
would, indeed, be strange if there were not some
behind the moon as well as all around her.</p>

<p>A moment's consideration shows that this must
often be the case; and in fact, if the moon's advancing
edge be scrutinized carefully through a
telescope, small stars can be seen frequently to
disappear behind it. This is a most interesting
observation. At first we see the moon and star
near each other in the telescope's field of view.
But the distance between them lessens perceptibly,
even quickly, until at last, with a startling
suddenness, the star goes out of sight behind the
moon. After a time, ranging from a few moments
to, perhaps, more than an hour, the moon
will pass, and we can see the star suddenly reappear
from behind the other edge.</p>

<p>These interesting observations, while not at all
uncommon, can be made only very rarely by
naked-eye astronomers. The reason is simple.
The moon's light is so brilliant that it fairly overcomes
the stars whenever they are at all near, except
in the case of very bright ones. Small
stars that can be followed quite easily up to the
moon's edge in a good telescope, disappear from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
a naked-eye view while the moon is still a long
distance away. But the number of very bright
stars is comparatively small, so that it is quite unusual
to find anyone not a professional astronomer
who has actually seen one of these so-called
"occultations." Moreover, most people are not
informed in advance of the occurrence of an opportunity
to make such observations, although
they can be predicted quite easily by the aid of
astronomical calculations. Sometimes we have
occultations of planets, and these are the most interesting
of all. When the moon passes between
us and one of the larger planets, it is worth
while to observe the phenomenon even without a
telescope.</p>

<p>Up to this point we have considered occultations
chiefly as being of interest to the naked-eye
astronomer. Yet occultations have a real scientific
value. It is by their means that we can,
perhaps, best measure the moon's size. By noting
with a telescope the time of disappearance
and reappearance of known stars, astronomers
can bring the direct measurement of the moon's
diameter within the range of their numerical cal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>culations.
Sometimes the moon passes over a
condensed cluster of stars like the Pleiades.
The results obtainable on these occasions are
valuable in a very high degree, and contribute
largely to making precise our knowledge of the
lunar diameter.</p>

<p>There is another thing of scientific interest
about occultations, though it has lost some of
its importance in recent years. When such an
event has been observed, the agreement of the
predicted time with that actually recorded by the
astronomer offers a most searching test of the
correctness of our theory of lunar motion. We
have already called attention to the great inherent
difficulty of this theory. It is easy to see
that by noting the exact instant of disappearance
of a star at a place on the earth the latitude and
longitude of which are known, we can both
check our calculations and gather material for
improving our theory. The same principle can
be used also in the converse direction. Within
the limits of precision imposed by the state of
our knowledge of lunar theory, we can utilize
occultations to help determine the position on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
earth of places whose longitude is unknown. It
is a very interesting bit of history that the first
determination of the longitude of Washington
was made by means of occultations, and that this
early determination led to the founding of the
United States Naval Observatory.</p>

<p>On March 28, 1810, Mr. Pitkin, of Connecticut,
reported to the House of Representatives
on "laying a foundation for the establishment of
a first meridian for the United States, by which
a further dependence on Great Britain or any
other foreign nation for such meridian may be
entirely removed." This report was the result
of a memorial presented by one William Lambert,
who had deduced the longitude of the Capitol
from an occultation observed October 20,
1804. Various proceedings were had in Congress
and in committee, until at last, in 1821,
Lambert was appointed "to make astronomical
observations by lunar occultations of fixed stars,
solar eclipses, or any approved method adapted
to ascertain the longitude of the Capitol from
Greenwich." Lambert's reports were made in
1822 and 1823, but ten years passed before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
establishment of a formal Naval Observatory under
Goldsborough, Wilkes, and Gilliss. But to
Lambert belongs the honor of having marked
out the first fundamental official meridian of
longitude in the United States.</p>

<h2><a name="MOUNTING_GREAT_TELESCOPES" id="MOUNTING_GREAT_TELESCOPES"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">MOUNTING GREAT TELESCOPES</a></h2>


<p>There are many interesting practical things
about an astronomical observatory with which
the public seldom has an opportunity to become
acquainted. Among these, perhaps, the details
connected with setting up a great telescope take
first rank. The writer happened to be present
at the Cape of Good Hope Observatory when
the photographic equatorial telescope was being
mounted, and the operation of putting it in position
may be taken as typical of similar processes
elsewhere. (See also <a href="#Page_86">p. 86.</a>)</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="P_170" id="P_170"></a>
<br />

</div>

<p>In the first place, it is necessary to explain
what is meant by an "equatorial" telescope.
One of the chief difficulties in making ordinary
observations arises from the rising and setting of
the stars. They are all apparently moving across
the face of the sky, usually climbing up from the
eastern horizon, only to go down again and set
in the west. If, therefore, we wish to scrutinize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>any given object for a considerable time, we must
move the telescope continuously so as to keep
pace with the motion of the heavens. For this
purpose, the tube must be attached to axles, so
that it can be turned easily in any direction.
The equatorial mounting is a device that permits
the telescope to be thus aimed at any part of the
sky, and at the same time facilitates greatly the
operation of keeping it pointed correctly after a
star has once been brought into the field of view.</p>

<p>To understand the equatorial mounting it is
necessary to remember that the rising and setting
motions of the heavenly bodies are apparent ones
only, and due in reality to the turning of the
earth on its own axis. As the earth goes around,
it carries observer, telescope, and observatory past
the stars fixed upon the distant sky. Consequently,
to keep a telescope pointed continuously
at a given star, it is merely necessary to rotate it
steadily backward upon a suitable axis just fast
enough to neutralize exactly the turning of our
earth.</p>

<p>By a suitable axis for this purpose we mean
one so mounted as to be exactly parallel to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
earth's own axis of rotation. A little reflection
shows how simply such an arrangement will
work. All the heavenly bodies may be regarded,
for practical purposes, as excessively remote
in comparison with the dimensions of our
earth. The entire planet shrinks into absolute
insignificance when compared with the distances
of the nearest objects brought under observation
by astronomers. It follows that if we have our
telescope attached to such a rotation-axis as we
have described, it will be just the same for purposes
of observation as though the telescope's
axis were not only parallel to the earth's axis, but
actually coincident with it. The two axes may
be separated by a distance equal to that between
the earth's surface and its centre; but, as we
have said, this distance is insignificant so far as
our present object is concerned.</p>

<p>There is another way to arrive at the same
result. We know that the stars in rising and
setting all seem to revolve about the pole star,
which itself seems to remain immovable. Consequently,
if we mount our telescope so that it
can turn about an axis pointing at the pole, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
shall be able to neutralize the rotation of the stars
by simply turning the telescope about the axis at
the proper speed and in the right direction. Astronomical
considerations teach us that an axis
thus pointing at the pole will be parallel to the
earth's own axis. Thus we arrive at the same
fundamental principle for mounting an astronomical
telescope from whichever point of view we
consider the subject.</p>

<p>Every large telescope is provided with such an
axis of rotation; and for the reason stated it is
called the "polar axis." The telescope itself is
then called an "equatorial." The advantage of
this method of mounting is very evident. Since
we can follow the stars' motions by turning the
telescope about one axis only, it becomes a very
simple matter to accomplish this turning automatically
by means of clock-work.</p>

<p>The "following" of a star being thus provided
for by the device of a polar axis, it is, of course,
also necessary to supply some other motion so as
to enable us to aim the tube at any point in the
heavens. For it is obvious that if it were rigidly
attached to the polar axis, we could, indeed, follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
any star that happened to be in the field of view,
but we could not change this field of view at will
so as to observe other stars or planets. To accomplish
this, the telescope is attached to the
polar axis by means of a pivot. By turning the
telescope around its polar axis, and also on this
pivot, we can find any object in the heavens; and
once found, we can leave to the polar axis and its
automatic clock-work the task of keeping that
object before the observer's eye.</p>

<p>In setting up the Cape of Good Hope instrument
the astronomers were obliged to do a large
part of the work of adjustment personally. Far
away from European instrument-makers, the parts
of the mounting and telescope had to be "assembled,"
or put together, by the astronomers of the
Cape Observatory. A heavy pier of brick and
masonry had been prepared in advance. Upon
this was placed a massive iron base, intended to
support the superstructure of polar axis and telescope.
This base rested on three points, one of
which could be screwed in and out, so as to tilt
the whole affair a little forward or backward.
By means of this screw we effected the final ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>justment
of the polar axis to exact parallelism
with that of the earth. Other screws were provided
with which the base could be twisted a little
horizontally either to the right or left. Once set
up in a position almost correct, it was easy to perfect
the adjustment by the aid of these screws.</p>

<p>Afterward the tube and lenses were put in
place, and the clock properly attached inside the
big cast-iron base. This clock-work looked more
like a piece of heavy machinery than a delicate
clock mechanism. But it had heavy work to do,
carrying the massive telescope with its weighty
lenses, and needed to be correspondingly strong.
It had a driving-weight of about 2,000 pounds,
and was so powerful that turning the telescope
affected it no more than the hour-hand of an ordinary
clock affects the mechanism within its case.</p>

<p>The final test of the whole adjustment consisted
in noting whether stars once brought into
the telescopic field of view could be maintained
there automatically by means of the clock. This
object having been attained successfully, the instrument
stood ready to be used in the routine
business of the observatory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of telescope-mountings,
we must mention the giant instrument set
up at the Paris Exposition of 1900. The project
of having a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Lunette</i> had been hailed by
newspapers throughout the world and by the
general public in their customary excitable way.
It was tremendously over-advertised; exaggerated
notions of the instrument's powers were
spread abroad and eagerly credited; the moon
was to be dragged down, as it were, from its
customary place in the sky, so near that we
should be able almost to touch its surface. As
to the planets&mdash;free license was given to the journalistic
imagination, and there was no effective
limitation to the magnificence of astronomical
discovery practically within our grasp, beyond
the necessity for printed space demanded by sundry
wars, pestilences, and other mundane trifles.</p>

</div>

<p>Now, the present writer is very far from advocating
a lessening of the attention devoted to astronomy.
Rather would he magnify his office
than diminish it. But let journalistic astronomy
be as good an imitation of sober scientific truth
as can be procured at space rates; let editors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>encourage the public to study those things in the
science that are ennobling and cultivating to the
mind; let there be an end to the frenzied effort
to fabricate a highly colored account of alleged
discoveries of yesterday, capable of masquerading
to-day under heavy head-lines as News.</p>

<p>The manner in which the big telescope came
to be built is not without interest, and shows
that enterprise is far from dead, even in the old
countries. A stock company was organized&mdash;we
should call it a corporation&mdash;under the
name <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Société de l'Optique</i>. It would appear that
shares were regularly put on the market, and
that a prospectus, more or less alluring, was
widely distributed. We may say at once that the
investing public did not respond with obtrusive
alacrity; but at all events, the promoters' efforts
received sufficient encouragement to enable them
to begin active work. From the very first a
vigorous attempt was made to utilize both the
resources of genuine science and the devices of
quasi-charlatanry. It was announced that the
public were to be admitted to look through the
big glass (apparently at so much an eye), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
many, doubtless, expected that the man in the
street would be able to make personal acquaintance
with the man in the moon. A telescopic
image of the sun was to be projected on a big
screen, and exhibited to a concourse of spectators
assembled in rising tiers of seats within a
great amphitheatre. And when clouds or other
circumstances should prevent observing the planets
or scrutinizing the sun, a powerful stereopticon
was to be used. Artificial pictures of the
wonders of heaven were to be projected on the
screen, and the public would never be disappointed.
It was arranged that skilled talkers
should be present to explain all marvels: and, in
short, financial profit was to be combined with
machinery for advancing scientific discovery.
Astronomers the world over were "circularized,"
asked to become shareholders, and, in default of
that, to send lantern-slides or photographs of
remarkable celestial objects for exhibition in the
magic-lantern part of the show.</p>

<p>The project thus brought to the attention of
scientific men three years ago did not have an
attractive air. It savored too much of charlatan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>ism.
But it soon appeared that effective government
sanction had been given to the enterprise;
and, above all, that men of reputation
were allowing the use of their names in connection
with the affair. More important still, we
learned that the actual construction had been
undertaken by Gautier, of Paris, that finances
were favorable, and that real work on parts of
the instrument was to commence without delay.</p>

<p>Gautier is a first-class instrument-builder; he
has established his reputation by constructing successfully
several telescopes of very large size, including
the <em>equatorial coudé</em> of the Paris Observatory,
a unique instrument of especial complexity.
The present writer believes that, if sufficient time
and money were available, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Lunette</i>
would stand a reasonable chance of success in
the hands of such a man. And by a reasonable
chance, we mean that there is a large enough
probability of genuine scientific discovery to
justify the necessary financial outlay. But the
project should be divorced from its "popular"
features, and every kind of advertising and charlatanism
excluded with rigor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>As planned originally, and actually constructed,
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Lunette</i> presents interesting peculiarities,
distinguishing it from other telescopes. Previous
instruments have been built on the principle
of universal mobility. It is possible to
move them in all directions, and thus bring any
desired star under observation, irrespective of its
position in the sky. But this general mobility
offers great difficulties in the case of large and
ponderous telescopes. Delicacy of adjustment is
almost destroyed when the object to be adjusted
weighs several tons. And the excessive weight
of telescopes is not due to unavoidably heavy
lenses alone. It is essential that the tube be
long; and great length involves appreciable
thickness of material, if stiffness and solidity are
to remain unsacrificed. Length in the tube is
necessitated by certain peculiar optical defects of
all lenses, into the nature of which we shall not
enter at present. The consequences of these
defects can be rendered harmless only if the instrument
is so arranged that the observer's eye is
far from the other end of the tube. The length
of a good telescope should be at least twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
times the diameter of its large lens. If the relative
length can be still further increased, so
much the better; for then the optical defects
can be further reduced.</p>

<p>In the case of the Paris instrument a radical
departure consists in making the tube of unprecedented
length, 197 feet, with a lens diameter of
49¼ inches. This great length, while favorable
optically, precludes the possibility of making the
instrument movable in the usual sense. In fact,
the entire tube is attached to a fixed horizontal
base, and no attempt is made to change its position.
Outside the big lens, and disconnected
altogether from the telescope proper, is mounted
a smooth mirror, so arranged that it can be
turned in any direction, and thus various parts of
the sky examined by reflection in the telescope.</p>

<p>While this method unquestionably has the advantage
of leaving the optician quite free as to
how long he will make his tube, it suffers from
the compensating objection that a new optical
surface is introduced into the combination, viz.,
the mirror. Any slight unavoidable imperfection
in the polishing of its surface will infallibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
be reproduced on a magnified scale in the image
of a distant star brought before the observer's
eye.</p>

<p>But it is not yet possible to pronounce definitely
upon the merit of this form of instrument,
since, as we have said, the maker has not been
given time enough to try the idea to the complete
satisfaction of scientific men. In the early
part of August, 1900, when the informant of the
present writer left Paris, after serving as a member
of the international jury for judging instruments
of precision at the Exposition, the condition
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grande Lunette</i> was as follows: Two
sets of lenses had been contemplated, one intended
for celestial photography, and the other to be
used for ordinary visual observation. Only the
photographic lenses had been completed, however,
and for this reason the public could not be
permitted to look through the instrument. The
photographic lenses were in place in the tube, but
at that time their condition was such that, though
some photographs had been obtained, it was not
thought advisable to submit them to the jury.
Consequently, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lunette</i> did not receive a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
prize. Since that time various newspapers have
reported wonderful results from the telescope;
but, disregarding the fusillade from the sensational
press, we may sum up the present state of
affairs very briefly. Gautier is still experimenting;
and, given sufficient time and money, he
may succeed in producing what astronomers
hope for&mdash;an instrument capable of advancing
our knowledge, even if that advance be only a
small one.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ASTRONOMERS_POLE" id="THE_ASTRONOMERS_POLE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE ASTRONOMER'S POLE</a></h2>


<p>The pole of the frozen North is not the only
pole sought with determined effort by more than
one generation of scientific men. Up in the sky
astronomers have another pole which they are
following up just as vigorously as ever Arctic explorer
struggled toward the difficult goal of his terrestrial
journeying. The celestial pole is, indeed,
a fundamentally important thing in astronomical
science, and the determination of its exact position
upon the sky has always engaged the closest
attention of astronomers. Quite recently new
methods of research have been brought to bear,
promising a degree of success not hitherto attained
in the astronomers' pursuit of their pole.</p>

<p>In the first place, we must explain what is
meant by the celestial pole. We have already
mentioned the poles of the earth (<a href="#Page_136">p. 136</a>). Our
planet turns once daily upon an axis passing
through its centre, and it is this rotation that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
causes all the so-called diurnal phenomena of the
heavens. Rising and setting of sun, moon, and
stars are simply results of this turning of the
earth. Heavenly bodies do not really rise; it is
merely the man on the earth who is turned round
on an axis until he is brought into a position from
which he can see them. The terrestrial poles are
those two points on the earth's surface where it
is pierced by the rotation axis of the planet.
Now we can, if we choose, imagine this axis
lengthened out indefinitely, further and further,
until at last it reaches the great round vault of
the sky. Here it will again pierce out two polar
points; and these are the celestial poles.</p>

<p>The whole thing is thus quite easy to understand.
On the sky the poles are marked by
the prolongation of the earth's axis, just as on
the earth the poles are marked by the axis itself.
And this explains at once why the stars seem
nightly to revolve about the pole. If the observer
is being turned round the earth's axis, of
course it will appear to him as if the stars were
rotating around the same axis in the opposite
direction, just as houses and fields seem to fly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
past a person sitting in a railway train, unless he
stops to remember that it is really himself who is
in motion, and not the trees and houses.</p>

<p>The existence of such a centre of daily motions
among the stars once recognized, it becomes of
interest to ascertain whether the centre itself always
retains precisely the same position in the
sky. It was discovered as early as the time of
Hipparchus (<a href="#Page_39">p. 39</a>) that such is not the case,
and that the celestial pole is subject to a slow
motion among the stars on the sky. If a given
star were to-day situated exactly at the pole, it
would no longer be there after the lapse of a
year's time; for the pole would have moved away
from it.</p>

<p>This motion of the pole is called precession.
It means that certain forces are continually at
work, compelling the earth's axis to change its
position, so that the prolongation of that axis
must pierce the sky at a point which moves as
time goes on. These forces are produced by the
gravitational attractions of the sun, moon, and
planets upon the matter composing our earth.
If the earth were perfectly spherical in shape,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the attractions of the other heavenly bodies
would not affect the direction of the earth's rotation-axis
in the least. But the earth is not quite
globular in form; it is flattened a little at the
poles and bulges out somewhat at the equator.
(See <a href="#Page_135">p. 135.</a>)</p>

<p>This protuberant matter near the equator gives
the other bodies in the solar system an opportunity
to disturb the earth's rotation. The general
effect of all these attractions is to make the
celestial pole move upon the sky in a circle having
a radius of about 23½ degrees; and it requires
25,800 years to complete a circuit of this
precessional cycle. One of the most striking consequences
of this motion will be the change of the
polar star. Just at present the bright star Polaris
in the constellation of the Little Bear is very
close to the pole. But after the lapse of sufficient
ages the first-magnitude star Vega of the constellation
Lyra will in its turn become Guardian of the
Pole.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that the
motion of the pole proceeds quite uniformly, and
in an exact circle; the varying positions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
heavenly bodies whose attractions cause the phenomena
in question are such as to produce appreciable
divergencies from exact circular motion.
Sometimes the pole deviates a little to one side
of the precessional circle, and sometimes it deviates
on the other side. The final result is a
sort of wavy line, half on one side and half on
the other of an average circular curve. It takes
only nineteen years to complete one of these little
waves of polar motion, so that in the whole precessional
cycle of 25,800 years there are about
1,400 indentations. This disturbance of the polar
motion is called by astronomers nutation.</p>

<p>The first step in a study of polar motion is to
devise a method of finding just where the pole is
on any given date. If the astronomer can ascertain
by observational processes just where the
pole is among the stars at any moment, and can
repeat his observations year after year and generation
after generation, he will possess in time a
complete chart of a small portion at least of the
celestial pole's vast orbit. From this he can obtain
necessary data for a study of the mathematical
theory of attractions, and thus, perhaps, arrive at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
an explanation of the fundamental laws governing
the universe in which we live.</p>

<p>The instrument which has been used most extensively
for the study of these problems is the
transit (<a href="#Page_118">p. 118</a>) or the "meridian circle." This
latter consists of a telescope firmly attached to a
metallic axis about which it can turn. The axis
itself rests on massive stone supports, and is so
placed that it points as nearly as possible in an
east-and-west direction. Consequently, when the
telescope is turned about its axis, it will trace out
on the sky a great circle (the meridian) which
passes through the north and south points of the
horizon and the point directly overhead. The
instrument has also a metallic circle very firmly
fastened to the telescope and its axis. Let into
the surface of this circle is a silver disk upon
which are engraved a series of lines or graduations
by means of which it is <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'impossible to measure'">possible to measure</ins>
angles.</p>

<p>Observers with the meridian circle begin by
noting the exact instant when any given star
passes the centre of the field of view of the telescope.
This centre is marked with a cross made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
by fastening into the focus some pieces of ordinary
spider's web, which give a well-marked, delicate
set of lines, even under the magnifying power
of the telescope's eye-piece. In addition to thus
noting the time when the star crosses the field
of the telescope, the astronomer can measure by
means of the circle, how high up it was in the sky
at the instant when it was thus observed.</p>

<p>If the telescope of the meridian circle be turned
toward the north, and we observe stars close to
the pole, it is possible to make two different observations
of the same star. For the close polar
stars revolve in such small circles around the pole
of the heavens that we can observe them when
they are on the meridian either above the pole or
below it. Double observations of this class enable
us to obtain the elevation of the pole above
the horizon, and to fix its position with respect
to the stars.</p>

<p>Now, there is one very serious objection to
this method. In order to secure the two necessary
observations of the same star, it is essential
to be stationed at the instrument at two moments
of time separated by exactly twelve hours; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
one of the observations occurs in the night, the
other corresponding observation will occur in
daylight.</p>

<p>It is a fact not generally known that the
brighter stars can be seen with a telescope, even
when the sun is quite high above the horizon.
Unfortunately, however, there is only one star
close to the pole which is bright enough to be
thus observed in daylight&mdash;the polar star already
mentioned under the name Polaris. The fact
that we are thus limited to observations of a single
star has made it difficult even for generations of
astronomers to accumulate with the meridian circle
a very large quantity of observational material
suitable for the solution of our problem.</p>

<p>The new method of observation to which we
have referred above consists in an application of
photography to the polar problem. If we aim
at the pole a powerful photographic telescope,
and expose a photographic plate throughout the
entire night, we shall find that all stars coming
within the range of the plate will mark out little
circles or "trails" upon the developed negative.
It is evident that as the stars revolve about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
pole on the sky, tracing out their daily circular
orbits, these same little circles must be reproduced
faithfully upon the photographic plate.
The only condition is that the stars shall be
bright enough to make their light affect the sensitive
gelatine surface.</p>

<p>But even if observations of this kind are continued
throughout all the hours of darkness, we
do not obtain complete circles, but only those
portions of circles traced out on the sky between
sunset and sunrise. If the night is twelve hours
in length, we get half-circles on the plate; if it is
eighteen hours long, we get circles that lack only
one-quarter of being complete. In other words,
we get a series of circular arcs, one corresponding
to each close polar star. There are no fewer than
sixteen stars near enough to the pole to come
within the range of a photographic plate, and
bright enough to cause measurable impressions
upon the sensitive surface. The fact that the
circular arcs are not complete circles does not in
the least prevent our using them for ascertaining
the position of their common centre; and that
centre is the pole. Moreover, as the arcs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
distributed at all sorts of distances from the pole
and in all directions, corresponding to the accidental
positions of the stars on the sky, we have
a state of affairs extremely favorable to the accurate
determination of the pole's place among
the stars by means of microscopic measurements
of the plate.</p>

<p>It will be perceived that this method is extremely
simple, and, therefore, likely to be successful;
though its simplicity is slightly impaired
by the phenomenon known to astronomers as
"atmospheric refraction." The rays of light
coming down to our telescopes from a distant
star must pass through the earth's atmosphere
before they reach us; and in passing thus from
the nothingness of outer space into the denser
material of the air, they are bent out of their
straight course. The phenomenon is analogous
to what we see when we push a stick down
through the surface of still water; we notice that
the stick appears to be bent at the point where it
pierces the surface of the water; and in just the
same way the rays of light are bent when they
pierce into the air. Fortunately, the mathemati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>cal
theory of this atmospheric bending of light is
well understood, so that it is possible to remove
the effects of refraction from our results by a
process of calculation. In other words, we can
transform our photographic measures into what
they would have been if no such thing as atmospheric
refraction existed. This having been
done, all the arcs on the plate should be exactly
circular, and their common centre should be the
position of the pole among the stars on the night
when the photograph was made.</p>

<p>It is possible to facilitate the removal of refraction
effects very much by placing our photographic
telescope at some point on the earth situated
in a very high latitude. The elevation of
the pole above the horizon is greatest in high
latitudes. Indeed, if Arctic voyagers could ever
reach the pole of the earth they would see the
pole of the heavens directly overhead. Now,
the higher up the pole is in the sky, the less will
be the effects of atmospheric refraction; for the
rays of light will then strike the atmosphere in a
direction nearly perpendicular to its surface, which
is favorable to diminishing the amount of bending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>There is also another very important advantage
in placing the telescope in a high latitude;
in the middle of winter the nights are very
long there; if we could get within the Arctic.
Circle itself, there would be nights when the
hours of darkness would number twenty-four,
and we could substitute complete circles for our
broken arcs. This would, indeed, be most favorable
from the astronomical point of view; but
the essential condition of convenience for the observer
renders an expedition to the frozen Arctic
regions unadvisable.</p>

<p>But it is at least possible to place the telescope
as far north as is consistent with retaining
it within the sphere of civilized influences. We
can put it in that one of existing observatories on
the earth which has the highest latitude; and
this is the observatory of Helsingfors, in Finland,
which belongs to a great university, is
manned by competent astronomers, and has a
latitude greater than 60 degrees.</p>

<p>Dr. Anders Donner, Director of the Helsingfors
Observatory, has at its disposal a fine photographic
telescope, and with this some prelimi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>nary
experimental "trail" photographs were made
in 1895. These photographs were sent to Columbia
University, New York, and were there
measured under the writer's direction. Calculations
based on these measures indicate that the
method is promising in a very high degree; and
it was, therefore, decided to construct a special
photographic telescope better adapted to the particular
needs of the problem in hand.</p>

<p>The desirability of a new telescope arises from
the fact that we wish the instrument to remain absolutely
unmoved during all the successive hours
of the photographic exposure. It is clear that
if the telescope moves while the stars are tracing
out their little trails on the plate, the circularity
of the curves will be disturbed. Now, ordinary
astronomical telescopes are always mounted upon
very stable foundations, well adapted to making
the telescope stand still; but the polar telescope
which we wish to use in a research fundamental
to the entire science of astronomy ought to possess
immobility and stability of an order higher
than that required for ordinary astronomical purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a remarkable peculiarity of the instrument
needed for the new trail photographs that
it is never moved at all. Once pointed at the
pole, it is ready for all the observations of successive
generations of astronomers. It should
have no machinery, no pivots, axes, circles,
clocks, or other paraphernalia of the usual equatorial
telescope. All we want is a very heavy
stone pier, with a telescope tube firmly fastened
to it throughout its entire length. The top of
the pier having been cut to the proper angle of
the pole's elevation, and the telescope cemented
down, everything is complete from the instrumental
side; and just such an instrument as
this is now ready for use at Helsingfors.</p>

<p>The late Miss Catharine Wolfe Bruce, of
New York, was much interested in the writer's
proposed polar investigations, and in October,
1898, she contributed funds for the construction
of the new telescope, and the Russian authorities
have generously undertaken the expense of a
building to hold the instrument and the granite
foundation upon which it rests. Photographs
are now being secured with the new instrument,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and they will be sent to Columbia University,
New York, for measurement and discussion. It
is hoped that they will carry out the promise of
the preliminary photographs made in 1895 with
a less suitable telescope of the ordinary form.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MOON_HOAX" id="THE_MOON_HOAX"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE MOON HOAX</a></h2>


<p>The public attitude toward matters scientific
is one of the mysteries of our time. It can be
described best by the single word, Credulity;
simple, absolute credulity. Perfect confidence is
the most remarkable characteristic of this unbelieving
age. No charlatan, necromancer, or astrologer
of three centuries ago commanded more
respectful attention than does his successor of
to-day.</p>

<p>Any person can be a scientific authority; he
has but to call himself by that title, and everyone
will give him respectful attention. Numerous
instances can be adduced from the experience
of very recent years to show how true are these
remarks. We have had the Keeley motor and
the liquid-air power schemes for making something
out of nothing. Extracting gold from sea-water
has been duly heralded on scientific authority
as an easy source of fabulous wealth for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
million. Hard-headed business men not only
believe in such things, but actually invest in them
their most valued possession, capital. Venders
of nostrums and proprietary medicines acquire
wealth as if by magic, though it needs but a moment's
reflection to realize that these persons cannot
possibly be in possession of any drugs, or
secret methods of compounding drugs, that are
unknown to scientific chemists.</p>

<p>If the world, then, will persistently intrust its
health and wealth into the safe-keeping of charlatans,
what can we expect when things supposedly
of far less value are at stake? The famous Moon
Hoax, as we now call it, is truly a classic piece of
lying. Though it dates from as long ago as
1835, it has never had an equal as a piece of
"modern" journalism. Nothing could be more
useful than to recall it to public attention at least
once every decade; for it teaches an important
lesson that needs to be iterated again and again.</p>

<p>On November 13, 1833, Sir John Herschel
embarked on the Mountstuart Elphinstone, bound
for the Cape of Good Hope. He took with
him a collection of astronomical instruments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
with which he intended to study the heavens
of the southern hemisphere, and thus extend
his father's great work to the south polar stars.
An earnest student of astronomy, he asked no
better than to be left in peace to seek the truth
in his own fashion. Little did he think that his
expedition would be made the basis for a fabrication
of alleged astronomical discoveries destined
to startle a hemisphere. Yet that is precisely
what happened. Some time about the middle of
the year 1835 the New York <cite>Sun</cite> began the publication
of certain articles, purporting to give an
account of "Great Astronomical Discoveries,
lately made by Sir John Herschel at the Cape of
Good Hope." It was alleged that these articles
were taken from a supplement to the Edinburgh
<cite>Journal of Science</cite>; yet there is no doubt that
they were manufactured entirely in the United
States, and probably in New York.</p>

<p>The hoax begins at once in a grandiloquent
style, calculated to attract popular attention, and
well fitted to the marvels about to be related.
Here is an introductory remark, as a specimen:
"It has been poetically said that the stars of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
heaven are the hereditary regalia of man as the
intellectual sovereign of the animal creation. He
may now fold the zodiac around him with a
loftier consciousness of his mental supremacy."
Then follows a circumstantial and highly plausible
account of the manner in which early and exclusive
information was obtained from the Cape.
This was, of course, important in order to make
people believe in the genuineness of the whole;
but we pass at once to the more interesting account
of Herschel's supposed instrument.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more skilful than the way in
which an air of truth is cast over the coming account
of marvellous discoveries by explaining in
detail the construction of the imaginary Herschelian
instrument. Sir John is supposed to
have had an interesting conversation in England
"with Sir David Brewster, upon the merits of
some ingenious suggestion by the latter, in his article
on optics in the Edinburgh Encyclopædia
(p. 644), for improvements in the Newtonian
reflectors." The exact reference to a particular
page is here quite delightful. After some further
talk, "the conversation became directed to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
all-invincible enemy, the paucity of light in powerful
magnifiers. After a few moments' silent
thought, Sir John diffidently inquired whether it
would not be possible to effect a <em>transfusion of
artificial light through the focal object of vision</em>!
Sir David, somewhat startled at the originality of
the idea, paused awhile, and then hesitatingly referred
to the refrangibility of rays, and the angle
of incidence.... Sir John continued,
'Why cannot the illuminated microscope, say
the hydro-oxygen, be applied to render distinct,
and, if necessary, even to magnify the focal object?'
Sir David sprang from his chair in an
ecstasy of conviction, and leaping half-way to the
ceiling, exclaimed, 'Thou art the man.' "This
absurd imaginary conversation contains nothing
but an assemblage of optical jargon, put together
without the slightest intention of conveying any
intelligible meaning to scientific people. Yet it
was well adapted to deceive the public; and we
should not be surprised if it would be credited
by many newspaper readers to-day.</p>

<p>The authors go on to explain how money was
raised to build the new instrument, and then de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>scribe
Herschers embarkation and the difficulties
connected with transporting his gigantic machines
to the place selected for the observing
station. "Sir John accomplished the ascent to
the plains by means of two relief teams of oxen,
of eighteen each, in about four days, and, aided
by several companies of Dutch boors [<em>sic</em>], proceeded
at once to the erecting of his gigantic
fabric." The place really selected by Herschel
cannot be described better than in his own
words, contained in a genuine letter dated January
21, 1835: "A perfect paradise in rich and
magnificent mountain scenery, sheltered from all
winds.... I must reserve for my next all
description of the gorgeous display of flowers
which adorn this splendid country, as well as
the astonishing brilliancy of the constellations."
The author of the hoax could have had no
knowledge of Herschers real location, as described
in this letter.</p>

<p>The present writer can bear witness to the
correctness of Herschel's words. Feldhausen
is truly an ideal secluded spot for astronomical
study. A small obelisk under the sheer cliff of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
far-famed Table Mountain now marks the site
of the great reflecting telescope. Here Herschel
carried on his scrutiny of the Southern skies.
He observed 1,202 double stars and 1,708
nebulæ and clusters, of which only 439 were already
known. He studied the famous Magellanic
clouds, and made the first careful drawings
of the "keyhole" nebula in the constellation
Argo.</p>

<p>Very recent researches of the present royal
astronomer at the Cape have shown that changes
of import have certainly taken place in this
nebula since Herschel's time, when a sudden
blazing up of the wonderful star Eta Argus
was seen within the nebula. This object has,
perhaps, undergone more remarkable changes of
light than any other star in the heavens. It is
as though there were some vast conflagration at
work, now blazing into incandescence, and again
sinking almost into invisibility. In 1843 Maclear
estimated the brilliancy of Eta to be about
equal to that of Sirius, the brightest star in the
whole sky. Later it diminished in light, and
cannot be seen to-day with the naked eye, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the latest telescopic observations indicate that it
is again beginning to brighten.</p>

<p>Such was Herschel's quiet study of his beloved
science, in glaring contrast to the supposed discoveries
of the "Hoax." Here are a few things
alleged to have been seen on the moon. The
first time the instrument was turned upon our satellite
"the field of view was covered throughout
its entire area with a beautifully distinct and even
vivid representation of basaltic rock." There
were forests, too, and water, "fairer shores never
angels coasted on a tour of pleasure. A beach of
brilliant white sand, girt with wild castellated
rocks, apparently of green marble."</p>

<p>There was animal life as well; "we beheld
continuous herds of brown quadrupeds, having
all the external characteristics of the bison,
but more diminutive than any species of the
bos genus in our natural history." There was
a kind of beaver, that "carries its young in
its arms like a human being," and lives in huts.
"From the appearance of smoke in nearly all of
them, there is no doubt of its (the beaver's) being
acquainted with the use of fire." Finally, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
was, of course, unavoidable, human creatures
were discovered. "Whilst gazing in a perspective
of about half a mile, we were thrilled with
astonishment to perceive four successive flocks of
large-winged creatures, wholly unlike any kind
of birds, descend with a slow, even motion from
the cliffs on the western side, and alight upon
the plain.... Certainly they were like human
beings, and their attitude in walking was
both erect and dignified."</p>

<p>We have not space to give more extended extracts
from the hoax, but we think the above
specimens will show how deceptive the whole
thing was. The rare reprint from which we have
extracted our quotations contains also some interesting
"Opinions of the American Press Respecting
the Foregoing Discovery." The <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite>
said: "No article, we believe, has appeared
for years, that will command so general a
perusal and publication. Sir John has added a
stock of knowledge to the present age that will
immortalize his name and place it high on the
page of science." The <cite>Mercantile Advertiser</cite>
said: "Discoveries in the Moon.&mdash;We com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>mence
to-day the publication of an interesting
article which is stated to have been copied from
the Edinburgh <cite>Journal of Science</cite>, and which made
its first appearance here in a contemporary journal
of this city. It appears to carry intrinsic evidence
of being an authentic document." Many other
similar extracts are given. The New York <cite>Evening
Post</cite> did not fall into the trap. The <cite>Evening
Post's</cite> remarks were as follows: "It is quite
proper that the <em>Sun</em> should be the means of shedding
so much light on the <em>Moon</em>. That there
should be winged people in the moon does not
strike us as more wonderful than the existence of
such a race of beings on the earth; and that there
does or did exist such a race rests on the evidence
of that most veracious of voyagers and circumstantial
of chroniclers, Peter Wilkins, whose celebrated
work not only gives an account of the
general appearance and habits of a most interesting
tribe of flying Indians, but also of all those
more delicate and engaging traits which the author
was enabled to discover by reason of the conjugal
relations he entered into with one of the females
of the winged tribe."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SUNS_DESTINATION" id="THE_SUNS_DESTINATION"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE SUN'S DESTINATION</a></h2>


<p>Three generations of men have come and
gone since the Marquis de Laplace stood before
the Academy of France and gave his demonstration
of the permanent stability of our solar system.
There was one significant fault in Newton's
superbly simple conception of an eternal
law governing the world in which we live. The
labors of mathematicians following him had
shown that the planets must trace out paths in
space whose form could be determined in advance
with unerring certainty by the aid of
Newton's law of gravitation. But they proved
just as conclusively that these planetary orbits,
as they are called, could not maintain indefinitely
the same shapes or positions. Slow indeed might
be the changes they were destined to undergo;
slow, but sure, with that sureness belonging to
celestial science alone. And so men asked:
Has this magnificent solar system been built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
upon a scale so grand, been put in operation subject
to a law sublime in its very simplicity, only
to change and change until at length it shall lose
every semblance of its former self, and end, perhaps,
in chaos or extinction?</p>

<p>Laplace was able to answer confidently, "No."
Nor was his answer couched in the enthusiastic
language of unbalanced theorists who work by
the aid of imagination alone. Based upon the
irrefragable logic of correct mathematical reasoning,
and clad in the sober garb of mathematical
formulæ, his results carried conviction to men of
science the world over. So was it demonstrated
that changes in our solar system are surely at
work, and shall continue for nearly countless
ages; yet just as surely will they be reversed at
last, and the system will tend to return again to
its original form and condition. The objection
that the Newtonian law meant ultimate dissolution
of the world was thus destroyed by Laplace.
From that day forward the law of gravitation
has been accepted as holding sway over all phenomena
visible within our planetary world.</p>

<p>The intricacies of our own solar system being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
thus illumined, the restless activity of the human
intellect was stimulated to search beyond for new
problems and new mysteries. Even more fascinating
than the movements of our sun and
planets are all those questions that relate to the
clustered stellar congeries hanging suspended
within the deep vault of night. Does the same
law of gravitation cast its magic spell over that
hazy cloud of Pleiades, binding them, like ourselves,
with bonds indissoluble? Who shall answer,
yes or no? We can only say that astronomers
have as yet but stepped upon the threshold
of the universe, and fixed the telescope's great
eye upon that which is within.</p>

<p>Let us then begin by reminding the reader
what is meant by the Newtonian law of gravitation.
It appears all things possess the remarkable
property of attracting or pulling each other.
Newton declared that all substances, solid, liquid,
or even gaseous&mdash;from the massive cliff of
rock down to the invisible air&mdash;all matter can
no more help pulling than it can help existing.
His law further formulates certain conditions
governing the manner in which this gravitational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
attraction is exerted; but these are mere matters
of detail; interest centres about the mysterious
fact of attraction itself. How can one thing pull
another with no connecting link through which
the pull can act? Just here we touch the point
that has never yet been explained. Nature withholds
from science her ultimate secrets. They
that have pondered longest, that have descended
farthest of all men into the clear well of knowledge,
have done so but to sound the depths beyond,
never touching bottom.</p>

<p>This inability of ours, to give a good physical
explanation of gravitation, has led certain makers
of paradoxes to doubt or even deny that there is
any such thing. But, fortunately, we have a simple
laboratory experiment that helps us. Unexplained
it may ever remain, but that there
can be attraction between physical objects connected
by no visible link is proved by the behavior
of an ordinary magnet. Place a small
piece of steel or iron near a magnetized bar, and
it will at once be so strongly attracted that it
will actually fly to the magnet. Anyone who
has seen this simple experiment can never again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
deny the possibility, at least, of the law of attraction
as stated by Newton. Its possibility once
admitted, the fact that it can predict the motions
of all the planets, even down to their minutest
details, transforms the possibility of its truth into
a certainty as strong as any human certainty can
ever be.</p>

<p>But this demonstration of Newton's law is
limited strictly to the solar system itself. We
may, indeed, reason by analogy, and take for
granted that a law which holds within our immediate
neighborhood is extremely likely to be true
also of the entire visible universe. But men of
science are loath to reason thus; and hence the
fascination of researches in cosmic astronomy.
Analogy points out the path. The astronomer
is not slow to follow; but he seeks ever to
establish upon incontrovertible evidence those
truths which at first only his daring imagination
had led him to half suspect.</p>

<p>If we are to extend the law of gravitation to
the utmost, we must be careful to consider the
law itself in its most complete form. A heavenly
body like the sun is often said to govern the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
motions of its family of planets; but such a statement
is not strictly accurate. The governing
body is no despot; 'tis an abject slave of law and
order, as much as the tiniest of attendant planets.
The action of gravitation is mutual, and no
cosmic body can attract another without being
itself in turn subject to that other's gravitational
action.</p>

<p>If there were in our solar system but two bodies,
sun and planet, we should find each one pursuing
a path in space under the influence of the
other's attraction. These two paths or orbits
would be oval, and if the sun and planet were
equally massive, the orbits would be exactly
alike, both in shape and size. But if the sun
were far larger than the planet, the orbits would
still be similar in form, but the one traversed by
the larger body would be small. For it is not
reasonable to expect a little planet to keep the
big sun moving with a velocity as great as that
derived by itself from the attraction of the
larger orb.</p>

<p>Whenever the preponderance of the larger
body is extremely great, its orbit will be corre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>spondingly
insignificant in size. This is in fact
the case with our own sun. So massive is it in
comparison with the planets that the orbit is too
small to reveal its actual existence without the
aid of our most refined instruments. The path
traced out by the sun's centre would not fill a
space as large as the sun's own bulk. Nevertheless,
true orbital motion is there.</p>

<p>So we may conclude that as a necessary consequence
of the law of gravitation every object
within the solar system is in motion. To say
that planets revolve about the sun is to neglect
as unimportant the small orbit of the sun itself.
This may be sufficiently accurate for ordinary
purposes; but it is unquestionably necessary to
neglect no factor, however small, if we propose
to extend our reasoning to a consideration of the
stellar universe. For we shall then have to deal
with systems in which the planets are of a size
comparable with the sun; and in such systems
all the orbits will also be of comparatively equal
importance.</p>

<p>Mathematical analysis has derived another fact
from discussion of the law of gravitation which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
perhaps, transcends in simple grandeur everything
we have as yet mentioned. It matters not
how great may be the number of massive orbs
threading their countless interlacing curved paths
in space, there yet must be in every cosmic system
one single point immovable. This point is
called the Centre of Gravity. If it should so
happen that in the beginning of things, some
particle of matter were situated at this centre,
then would that atom ever remain unmoved and
imperturbable throughout all the successive vicissitudes
of cosmic evolution. It is doubtful
whether the mind of man can form a conception
of anything grander than such an immovable
atom within the mysterious intricacies of cosmic
motion.</p>

<p>But in general, we cannot suppose that the
centres of gravity in the various stellar systems
are really occupied by actual physical bodies.
The centre may be a mere mathematical point in
space, situated among the several bodies composing
the system, but, nevertheless, endowed, in a
certain sense, with the same remarkable property
of relative immobility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Having thus defined the centre of gravity in
its relation to the constituent parts of any cosmic
system, we can pass easily to its characteristic
properties in connection with the inter-relation
of stellar systems with one another. It can be
proved mathematically that our solar system will
pull upon distant stars just as though the sun
and all the planets were concentrated into one
vast sphere having its centre in the centre of
gravity of the whole. It is this property of the
centre of gravity which makes it pre-eminently
important in cosmic researches. For, while we
know that centre to be at rest relatively to all
the planets in the system, it may, nevertheless,
in its quality as a sort of concentrated essence of
them all, be moving swiftly through space under
the pull of distant stars. In that case, the attendant
bodies will go with it&mdash;but they will
pursue their evolutions within the system, all unconscious
that the centre of gravity is carrying
them on a far wider circuit.</p>

<p>What is the nature of that circuit? This
question has been for many years the subject of
earnest study by the clearest minds among as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>tronomers.
The greatest difficulty in the way is
the comparatively brief period during which men
have been able to make astronomical observations
of precision. Space and time are two conceptions
that transcend the powers of definition
possessed by any man. But we can at least
form a notion of how vast is the extent of time,
if we remember that the period covered by man's
written records is registered but as a single moment
upon the great revolving dial of heaven's
dome. One hundred and fifty years have
elapsed since James Bradley built the foundations
of modern sidereal astronomy upon his masterly
series of observations at the Royal Observatory
of Greenwich, in England. Yet so slowly
do the movements of the stars unroll themselves
upon the firmament, that even to this day no
one of them has been seen by men to trace out
more than an infinitesimal fraction of its destined
path through the voids of space.</p>

<p>Travellers upon a railroad cannot tell at any
given moment whether they are moving in a
straight line, or whether the train is turning
upon some curve of huge size. The St. Goth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>ard
railway has several so-called "corkscrew"
tunnels, within which the rails make a complete
turn in a spiral, the train finally emerging from
the tunnel at a point almost vertically over the
entrance. In this way the train is lifted to a
higher level. Passengers are wont to amuse
themselves while in these tunnels by watching
the needle of an ordinary pocket-compass. This
needle, of course, always points to the north;
and as the train turns upon its curve, the needle
will make a complete revolution. But the passenger
could not know without the compass
that the train was not moving in a perfectly
straight line. Just so we passengers on the
earth are unaware of the kind of path we are
traversing, until, like the compass, the astronomer's
instruments shall reveal to us the
truth.</p>

<p>But as we have seen, astronomical observations
of precision have not as yet extended through a
period of time corresponding to the few minutes
during which the St. Gothard traveller watches
the compass. We are still in the dark, and do
not know as yet whether mankind shall last long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
enough upon the earth to see the compass needle
make its revolution. We are compelled to believe
that the motion in space of our sun is progressing
upon a curved path; but so far as precise
observations allow us to speak, we can but
say that we have as yet moved through an infinitesimal
element only of that mighty curve. However,
we know the point upon the sky toward
which this tiny element of our path is directed,
and we have an approximate knowledge of the
speed at which we move.</p>

<p>More than a century ago Sir William Herschel
was able to fix roughly what we call the apex of
the sun's way in space, or the point among the
stars toward which that way is for the moment
directed. We say for the moment, but we mean
that moment of which Bradley saw the beginning
in 1750, and upon whose end no man of those
now living shall ever look. Herschel found that
a comparison of old stellar observations seemed
to indicate that the stars in a certain part of the
sky were opening out, as it were, and that the
constellations in the opposite part of the heavens
seemed to be drawing in, or becoming smaller.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
There can be but one reasonable explanation of
this. We must be moving toward that part of
the sky where the stars are separating. Just so a
man watching a regiment of soldiers approaching,
will see at first only a confused body of men;
but as they come nearer, the individual soldiers
will seem to separate, until at length each one is
seen distinct from all the others.</p>

<p>Herschel fixed the position of the apex at a
point in the constellation Hercules. The most
recent investigations of Newcomb and others
have, on the whole, verified Herschel's conclusions.
With the intuitive power of rare genius,
Herschel had been able to sift truth out of error.
The observational data at his disposal would now
be called rude, but they disclosed to the scrutiny
of his acute understanding the germ of truth that
was in them. Later investigators have increased
the precision of our knowledge, until we can now
say that the present direction of the solar motion
is known within very narrow limits. A tiny circle
might be drawn on the sky, to which an astronomer
might point his hand and say: "Yonder little
circle contains the goal toward which the sun and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
planets are hastening to-day." Even the speed
of this motion has been subjected to measurement,
and found to be about ten miles per
second.</p>

<p>The objective point and the rate of motion
thus stated, exact science holds her peace. Here
genuine knowledge stops; and we can proceed
further only by the aid of that imagination which
men of science need to curb at every moment.
But let no one think that the sun will ever
reach the so-called apex. To do so would mean
cosmic motion upon a straight line, while every
consideration of celestial mechanics points to motion
upon a curve. When shall we turn sufficiently
upon that curve to detect its bending?
'Tis a problem we must leave as a rich heritage
to later generations that are to follow us. The
visionary theorist's notion of a great central sun,
controlling our own sun's way in space, must be
dismissed as far too daring. But for such a central
sun we may substitute a central centre of
gravity belonging to a great system of which our
sun is but an insignificant member. Then we
reach a conception that has lost nothing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
grandeur of its simplicity, and is yet in accord
with the probabilities of sober mechanical science.
We cease to be a lonely world, and stretch out
the bonds of a common relationship to yonder
stars within the firmament.</p>

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
